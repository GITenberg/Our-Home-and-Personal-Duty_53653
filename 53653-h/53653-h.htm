<h2>CIVICS FOR AMERICAN CHILDREN</h2>


<p>The notion of what constitutes adequate civics teaching
in our schools is rapidly changing. The older idea was
based on the theory that children were not citizens—that
only adults were citizens. Therefore, civics teaching was
usually deferred to the eighth grade, or last year of
the grammar school, and then was mostly confined to a
memorizing of the federal constitution, with brief comments
on each clause. Today we recognize that even
young children are citizens, just as much as adults are,
and that what is wanted is not training <i>for</i> citizenship but
training <i>in</i> citizenship. Moreover, we believe that the
“good citizen” is one who is good for something in all
the relationships of life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Habit Formation</span></h3>

<p>Accordingly, a beginning is being made with the early
school years, where an indispensable foundation is laid
through a training in “morals and manners.” This sounds
rather old-fashioned, but nothing has been discovered
to take its place. Obedience, cleanliness, orderliness,
courtesy, helpfulness, punctuality, truthfulness, care of
property, fair play, thoroughness, honesty, respect, courage,
self-control, perseverance, thrift, kindness to animals,
“safety first”—these are the fundamental civic virtues
which make for good citizenship in the years to come.
Of course, the object is to establish right habits of thought
and action, and this takes time and patience and sympathy;
but the end in view justifies the effort. The boy or girl
who has become habitually orderly and courteous and
helpful and punctual and truthful, and who has acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
a fair degree of courageous self-control, is likely to become
a citizen of whom any community may well be proud.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dramatization</span></h3>

<p>The best results are found to be secured through stories,
poems, songs, games, and the dramatization of the stories
found in books or told by the teacher. This last is of great
value, for it sets up a sort of brief life-experience for the
child that leaves a more lasting impression than would
the story by itself. Most of the stories told in this reader,
emphasizing certain of the civic virtues enumerated above,
will be found to lend themselves admirably to simple dramatization
by the pupils, the children’s imagination supplying
all deficiencies in costumes, scenery, and stage settings.
Moreover, the questions following the text will help the
teacher to “point the moral” without detracting in the
slightest degree from the interest of the story.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Community Servants</span></h3>

<p>The basis for good citizenship having been laid through
habit-formation in the civic virtues, the next step is for
the children to learn how these virtues are being embodied
in the people round about them who are serving them and
their families. The baker, the milkman, the grocer, the
dressmaker, the shoemaker, the carpenter, the plumber,
the painter, the physician, the druggist, the nurse—these
are the community servants who come closest to the life-experience
of the children.</p>

<p>How dependent each member of a community—especially
an urban community—is on all the rest, and how important
it is that each shall contribute what he can to the community’s
welfare, are illustrated by the stories of the Duwell
family. Here a typical though somewhat ideal American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
family is shown in its everyday relations, as a constant
recipient of the services rendered by those community
agents who supply the fundamental need of food, clothing,
shelter, and medical attendance. The children in the
class will learn, with the Duwell children, both the actual
services that are rendered and the family’s complete
dependence on those services. Moreover, they will acquire
the splendid working ideals of interdependence and coöperation.
And, finally, they will discover that the adult
citizens who are rendering them these services are embodying
the very civic virtues in which they themselves have
been so carefully trained.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Public Servants</span></h3>

<p>The pupils are now ready to follow the services rendered
by public servants such as the policeman, the fireman,
the street cleaner, the ashes and garbage collector, the
mail carrier; and by those who furnish water, gas, electricity,
the telephone, the trolley, etc.; and these are presented
in civics readers that follow this one. The civic virtues
previously considered are again found exemplified to a
marked degree; and the threefold idea of dependence, interdependence,
and coöperation through community agencies
finds ample illustration.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Training for Citizenship</span></h3>

<p>But it is not enough for the pupils to stop with finding
out what the community is doing for them. The essential
thing in this citizenship-training is for the young citizens
to find out what they can do to help things along. Civic
activities are suggested both in the stories, poems, etc.,
in these books, and in the suggestive questions at the close
of each chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Like all texts or other helps in education, these civics
readers cannot teach themselves or take the place of a
live teacher. But it is believed that they can be of great
assistance to sympathetic, civically minded instructors of
youth who feel that the training of our children in the
ideals and practices of good citizenship is the most imperative
duty and at the same time the highest privilege that
can come to any teacher.</p>

</div>

<p>It may be said that a child’s life and experience move forward in ever
widening circles, beginning with the closest intimate home relations,
and broadening out into knowledge of community, of city, and finally of
national life.</p>

<p>A glance at the above diagram will show the working plan of the Young
American Readers. This plan follows the natural growth and development
of the child’s mind, and aims by teaching the civic virtues and simplest
community relations to lay the foundations of good citizenship. See Outline
of Work on page 231.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE PRAIRIE DOGS AND<br />
OLD MR. WOLF</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, three fat little prairie dogs
lived together in a nice deep burrow, where they
were quite safe and warm and snug.</p>

<p>These little prairie dogs had very queer names.
One was Jump, another was Bump, and another
was Thump.</p>

<p>Well, they lived very happily together until one
day Jump said, “I believe I would rather live
up on top of the ground than in this burrow.”</p>

<p>“I believe I would, too,” said Bump.</p>

<p>“I believe I would!” said Thump. “I’ll tell
you what we can do! Let us each build a house!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us!” cried Jump and Bump, and away
they all scampered up out of the burrow.</p>

<p>Each one ran in a different direction to hunt
for something to use in building a house.</p>

<p>Jump gathered some straws.</p>

<p>“These will do,” he thought. “I shall not
bother to look for anything else. Besides, they
are very light and easy to carry.”</p>

<p>So Jump built a little straw house.</p>

<p>Bump gathered some sticks.</p>

<p>“These will make a nice house. They are
quite good enough,” he said.</p>

<p>So Bump built a little stick house.</p>

<p>Thump saw the straw and the sticks, but
thought he might find something better.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he came to a pile of stones.</p>

<p>“My, what a fine strong house they would
make!” he thought. “They are heavy to move,
but I will try to use them.”</p>

<p>So he carried and carried and worked and
worked, but finally he had a stone house.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The next morning when old Mr. Prairie Wolf
awoke and stretched himself, he saw the three
little houses in the distance.</p>

<p>“What can they be?” wondered old Mr. Wolf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
“Maybe I can get breakfast over there.” So
he started toward them.</p>

<p>The first house he came to was the straw one.</p>

<p>He peeped in the window and saw little Jump.</p>

<p>He knocked on the door. “Mr. Jump, let
me come in,” said he.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, by my bark—bark—bark! you cannot
come in,” barked little Jump, pushing with
all his might against the door with his little
paws.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll blow your house over with one big
breath!” growled old Mr. Prairie Wolf.</p>

<p>So he blew one mighty breath, and blew the
house over, and ate up poor little Jump.</p>

<p>On his way home, old Mr. Wolf stopped to
look in the window of the little stick house.
He saw little Bump.</p>

<p>“My, what a good breakfast I shall have to-morrow!”
he thought to himself.</p>

<p>The next morning he came early and knocked
on the door of the little stick house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bump, Mr. Bump,” said he, “let me
come in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, by my bark—bark—bark! you cannot
come in,” barked little Bump, standing on
his hind legs with his back braced against the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll throw your house over with one
blow of my paw,” growled old Mr. Prairie Wolf.</p>

<p>And he did, and ate up poor little Bump.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>On his way home, he stopped to look in the
window of the little stone house.</p>

<p>Thump sat by the fireplace toasting his feet.</p>

<p>“My, my!” chuckled old Mr. Wolf, smacking
his lips, “he is the fattest one of all. What a
fine breakfast I shall have to-morrow!”</p>

<p>The next morning he came earlier than ever,
and knocked on the door of the little stone house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thump, let me come in,” said he.</p>

<p>“All right,” called little Thump, “when my
feet get warm.”</p>

<p>So old Mr. Prairie Wolf sat down to wait.</p>

<p>By and by, old Mr. Wolf knocked on the door
again. “Aren’t your feet warm yet, Mr. Thump?”
he growled.</p>

<p>“Only one,” called Thump; “you will have to
wait until the other one is warm.”</p>

<p>So old Mr. Wolf sat down to wait.</p>

<p>After a few minutes had passed, he knocked
on the door again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t your other foot warm yet, Mr. Thump?”
he growled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” called Thump, “but the first one is
cold now.”</p>

<p>“See here, Mr. Thump,” growled old Mr.
Wolf, “do you intend to keep me waiting all day
while you warm first one foot and then the other?
I am tired of such foolishness. I want my breakfast.
Open the door, or I’ll knock your house
over!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” barked little Thump, “and
while you are doing it, I shall eat my breakfast.”</p>

<p>That made old Mr. Prairie Wolf very angry,
and he kicked at the little stone house with all
his might; but little Thump knew he could not
move a stone.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>After a long while the noise stopped, and little
Thump peeped out of the window. He saw old
Mr. Wolf limping painfully off; and that was
the way he always remembered him, for he never
never saw him again.</p>

<p>This story, which is built on the framework of the old classic,
“The Three Pigs,” lends itself readily to dramatization. Let the
four characters take their parts as they remember the story. By
no means have them memorize the words.</p></div>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Which little prairie dog worked hardest to build his house?</p>

<p>The others had an easy time, didn’t they?</p>

<p>But which one was happiest in the end? Why?</p></div>

<h2>THE BRIDGE OF THE SHALLOW PIER</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, a mother loved her little
boy so well that she made the mistake of offending
one of his good fairies. This was the fairy
of carefulness.</p>

<p>The mother made the mistake of trying to do
everything for her little son. She even put his
toys away when he was tired of playing.</p>

<p>After the boy grew older and went to school,
she did many of his lessons for him. His daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
marks in arithmetic were good, for much of
his work was done by his mother at home. Of
course his teacher did not know this for the boy
copied his mother’s work.</p>

<p>Now, just as you would expect, this made
the boy very careless. But he was really a
bright boy, and even though he did not do well,
he managed to pass his examinations.</p>

<p>“If you would only be more careful,” his
teachers would say, “you would have the highest
marks.”</p>

<p>When his mother saw his reports, she would
say: “Oh, isn’t this too bad, son; I know you
will have better marks next time.”</p>

<p>So, when the boy became a man he did everything
in the same careless manner, forgetting
that other people would not excuse him as his
mother had done.</p>

<p>Now the good fairy of carefulness was very
much offended at the way in which the mother
spoiled her little son. So she said to herself, “I
must, I must teach that boy a lesson!”</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>When he was little, this boy was very fond of
playing at building bridges. After he was grown
up, he became a builder of real bridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, he built only small bridges over the
brooks and little streams, but one day an order
was given him to build an important bridge over
a large river.</p>

<p>Just as you might guess, this pleased the man
very much, and he was glad to begin the work
at once.</p>

<p>Soon his men were busy, putting in the piers
for the new bridge, and he was hurrying them as
fast as he could, in order to get the bridge built
on time.</p>

<p>Every day he sat in a rowboat calling to his
men. They were about to begin work on the
middle pier when the foreman of the workers
came to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Builder,” he said, “I think we shall
have to wait for more material if we go down to
the right depth for this pier.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, man,” said the builder, “we have
no time to wait. There is a pretty good bottom
under that place. Don’t go so deep. Get along
with the material you have.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,—” began the man.</p>

<p>“Do as I tell you,” ordered the builder.</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” replied the foreman; “you
may order that done, but one of the other men
will have to do the job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” was the angry reply of the builder,
“Jim Nevermind will take your place.”</p>

<p>The foreman slowly drew on his jacket.
“Somebody will pay for such carelessness,” he
muttered. “I hope it will not be—” but the
rest of the sentence was drowned by the orders
of the new foreman.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In a very short time the bridge was finished
and the inspector came to look it over.</p>

<p>“It looks all right,” he said. “Are you sure
the piers are sound? I haven’t time to examine
them, but I know that a man who has built as
many bridges as you, would make them right.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you are pleased, sir,” replied the
builder.</p>

<p>“You have certainly made record time,” continued
the inspector, “and I shall carry back a
good report.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said the builder;
but his pleasure was somewhat spoiled because
of the shallow pier.</p>

<p>“It is all nonsense,” he thought, “to be so
particular; besides, the current in that river is
so slow that there is no danger.” And it seemed
true, for three years later, the bridge appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to be as firm and strong as when it was first
built.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>But one day in the early part of the fourth year
there came a great flood. The slow-moving current
became a raging torrent, sweeping everything
in its way and blocking large timbers and
trees against the bridge.</p>

<p>It so happened that a party of young people
were riding along in a big hay wagon drawn
by four beautiful bay horses. When they came
to the bridge the driver stopped.</p>

<p>“Shall we cross?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” the children shouted, “it will be
fun.”</p>

<p>“It looks safe enough,” said one of the two
grown people who were with them. So with a
“Gee-up, boys,” to the horses, the driver started
across the bridge.</p>

<p>Just—ah, you know, don’t you? Just as they
reached the middle pier, there came a creak and
a rumble, a moment’s swaying, and a crash.
The bridge had caved in, and the hay wagon,
full of terror-stricken children, together with the
frightened horses, was swept into the water.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump!” shouted the driver to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
children, trying to guide the swimming horses
shoreward; but that was impossible.</p>

<p>For a full minute, which seemed like hours,
they were swept onward. Then,—maybe the
good fairy of carefulness had planned it—they
rested on a little island the top of which was
just covered with water.</p>

<p>The white-faced driver counted the children,
“All here! Thank God!” he said.</p>

<p>The little folks cried and hugged each other,
and called aloud for their mothers and fathers.</p>

<p>They had to stay there all night, cold and
frightened and hungry. That was dreadful
enough, but it was nothing compared with the
fear that the water might rise higher still.</p>

<p>But slowly and steadily it went down, and by
early morning all of the little island was uncovered.
All the party were then quickly rescued
with boats.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The builder started, as the heading in the
evening paper caught his eye—“Terrible Bridge
Accident—Who is to Blame?”</p>

<p>“Why, why, it’s the bridge of the shallow
pier!” he exclaimed. “People will find out
that I am the one to blame!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall I run away?” he wondered, and sat for
hours with his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly he threw back his shoulders and said
aloud, “No, I will not run away. I will stay
and do what I can to make the bridge right and
never neglect my duty again!”</p>

<p>Do you wonder that the good fairy of carefulness,
and thoroughness, smiled and whispered,
“I wish he could have learned his lesson more
easily!”</p>

<h2>GRANDFATHER’S STORY</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Charles was fastening the lid on a box of
Christmas presents which his little brothers were
going to send to their cousins.</p>

<p>“If I were you, I’d put another nail on each
side,” said grandfather.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think these will hold,” Charles replied,
giving the box a little shake. “There are three,
on each side.”</p>

<p>“Four would be better,” grandfather said.</p>

<p>“Oh, grandpa, don’t you think three will do?”
asked the boy. “I—I haven’t any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“So that is the trouble,” said the old gentleman,
laughing. “Very well, here is some money.
When you get back from the store I will tell you
how the history of a whole great nation was
changed for want of a few horseshoe nails!”</p>

<p>“A few horseshoe nails!” exclaimed Charles.
“Is it true, grandpa?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” answered grandfather. “Now
hurry up if you want to hear how it came
about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” Charles cried, as he started
out of the door.</p>

<p>He was so delighted with the promise of one of
grandfather’s stories that he was back in less
time than if he had gone for candy!</p>

<p>“Well done!” grandfather greeted him.
“Now sit down, and while you get your breath,
I will tell you the story.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>“Many, many years ago, when King Richard
was ruler of England, he owned a beautiful horse
which he rode whenever he went into battle.</p>

<p>“One day word came that Henry, the Earl of
Richmond, was on his way to attack the king’s
men.</p>

<p>“King Richard ordered his favorite horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
brought to him, and turned to talk to the officers
of his army.</p>

<p>“Now the groom who had charge of the king’s
horses suddenly noticed that this horse needed
shoeing.</p>

<p>“So he hurried to the nearest smithy.</p>

<p>“‘Shoe this horse quickly,’ he said to the
blacksmith. ‘His Majesty has called for him.
The enemy is near!’</p>

<p>“The blacksmith worked with all his might,
and soon had four horseshoes ready.</p>

<p>“When he had nailed on two shoes, he found
he had not nails enough for the other two.
Suddenly the bugles sounded.</p>

<p>“‘Hurry!’ cried the groom. ‘The soldiers are
gathering!’</p>

<p>“‘Shall I make more nails?’ asked the blacksmith.</p>

<p>“‘How many have you?’ asked the groom.</p>

<p>“‘I have only eight,’ replied the smith. ‘It
would not take very long to hammer out eight
more.’</p>

<p>“‘You will have to make eight do,’ said the
groom.</p>

<p>“‘If you could only wait a little while,’ urged
the smith, working away.</p>

<p>“‘I suppose I might,—but it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
risk! Won’t four nails hold a horseshoe?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, that depends on how hard the horse
is ridden,’ answered the blacksmith, driving the
last of the eight nails in place.</p>

<p>“The horse reached the king in good time, for
it took quite a long while for the officers to make
their plans.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>“Soon King Richard was riding among his
men, cheering them on in the battle.</p>

<p>“‘No other horse could carry a man as surely
and swiftly,’ whispered the king, patting the
horse’s neck.</p>

<p>“He had not noticed that the horse had lost
one shoe. Onward he urged him over a rocky
hill. Another shoe flew off.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the horse stumbled and fell, and
the king was thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>“Before he could rise, the horse, although
lamed, had struggled to his feet and galloped
away, dreadfully frightened.</p>

<p>“Then the king shouted, ‘A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!’</p>

<p>“But there was no horse for him. When his
men had seen him thrown, they had all turned
and fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so the battle was lost, and King Richard
was killed, and the history of the great nation of
England was changed, for Henry, Earl of Richmond,
became king.”</p>

<p>“And all for the want of a few horseshoe
nails!”, finished Charles, as grandfather stopped
speaking. “I will put two more nails into each
side of the box lid, grandpa!”</p>

<p>“While you are doing that, I will teach you
a few lines that I learned when I was a boy,”
said grandfather. “Try to remember them.”</p>

<h2>HONEST ABE</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 244px;">
<img src="images/i-043.jpg" width="244" height="773" alt="young man studing at desk" />
</div>

<p>As a boy, Abraham
Lincoln was known as
“Honest Abe.” Like
other boys he sometimes
did wrong, but never did
he try to hide his wrongdoing.
He was always
ready to own up and tell
the truth. So his neighbors
called him “Honest
Abe.”</p>

<p>In this way he was like
young George Washington.
The American people
are fond of that kind
of boy. That is one of
the reasons why Lincoln
and Washington were
each twice elected President
of the United
States.</p>


<h3>I. The Broken Buck-horn</h3>

<p>When he was fourteen
years old, young Abraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
attended a log cabin school during the
winter.</p>

<p>Nailed to one of the logs in the schoolhouse
was a large buck’s head, high above the children’s
reach.</p>

<p>A hunter had shot a deer in the forest, and
presented the head, when mounted, to the school.
It had two unusually fine horns.</p>

<p>One day the teacher noticed that one of the
horns was broken off short.</p>

<p>Calling the school to order he asked who had
broken the horn.</p>

<p>“I did it,” answered young Lincoln promptly.
“I reached up and hung on the horn and it
broke. I should not have done so if I had
thought it would break.”</p>

<p>He did not wait until he was obliged to own
up, but did so at once.</p>

</div>


<h3>II. The Rain-soaked Book</h3>

<p>There were no libraries on the frontier in those
early days. When the boy Lincoln heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
anyone who had a book, he tried to borrow it,
often walking many miles to do so. He said
later that he had read through every book he
had heard of within fifty miles of the place
where he lived.</p>

<p>When living in Indiana he often worked as
a hired boy for a well-to-do farmer named Josiah
Crawford. Mr. Crawford owned a “Life of
George Washington,” a very precious book at
that time. The book-hungry boy borrowed it
to read.</p>

<p>One night he lay by the wood fire reading until
he could no longer see, and then he climbed the
ladder into the attic and went to bed under the
eaves. Before going to sleep he placed the book
between two logs of the walls of the cabin for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p>During the night a heavy rain-storm came up.
When young Lincoln examined the book in the
morning it was water soaked. The leaves were
wet through and the binding warped.</p>

<p>He dried the book as best he could by the fire
and then in fear and trembling took it home to
Mr. Crawford. After telling the story he asked
what he might do to make good the damaged
property.</p>

<p>To his relief, Mr. Crawford replied: “Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as it’s you, Abe, I won’t be hard on you. Come
over and shuck corn for three days and the book
is yours.”</p>

<p>Shuck corn for three days for such a book as
that! It was nothing! He felt as if Mr. Crawford
was making him a wonderful present.</p>

<p>After reading the book he often talked about
what he was going to do when he grew up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crawford, who was very fond of him,
would ask, “Well, Abe, what do you want to be
now?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be president,” he would declare.</p>

<p>She would laugh at him, and say, “You would
make a pretty president with all your tricks and
jokes, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll study and get ready, then the chance
will come,” he would reply.</p>

<h3>III. The Young Storekeeper</h3>

<p>At the age of twenty-one Abraham Lincoln
became a store clerk for a short time. He was
then six feet four inches tall and very strong.
He could out-run, out-jump, out-wrestle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
out-fight any man in the rough pioneer country
where he lived.</p>

<p>While the people respected his great strength,
they liked him still more for his honesty in little
things.</p>

<p>One evening, on reckoning up his accounts, he
found that in making change he had taken six
cents too much from a customer. On closing
the store he immediately walked three miles to
the farmhouse where the customer lived and returned
the six cents. Then he walked the three
miles back.</p>

<p>On opening the store one morning, he discovered
a four-ounce weight on the scales. He
remembered that his last customer the evening
before had purchased half a pound of tea. He
saw at once that he had given her short weight.
He measured out the four ounces still due, locked
the store, took a long walk to the customer’s
house, and explained the shortage.</p>

<p>These were little things, but Honest Abe could
not rest until he had made them right.</p>

<h2>DRY RAIN AND THE HATCHET</h2>


<h3>I. How Dry Rain Got His Name</h3>

<p>In the Indian country there was once a great
drought. The land was very dry. No rain had
fallen for many weeks. The crops and cattle
were suffering from thirst.</p>

<p>Now, in one of the tribes there was a young
Indian who had a very high opinion of himself.
He pretended that he could foretell what was
about to happen, long before it really did
happen.</p>

<p>So he foretold that on a certain day a
high wind would blow up, bringing with it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
great rain-storm with plenty of water for everybody.</p>

<p>The day came. Sure enough a high wind did
blow up, but it brought only a violent sand-storm
without a drop of rain, and it left the land
drier than before.</p>

<p>So the Indians laughed at the young man who
foretold before he knew and called him “Dry
Rain.”</p>

<p>Although he afterwards became a noted chief,
he never lost his name.</p>


<h3>II. Dry Rain Goes Trading</h3>

<p>One day, when he was an old man, Dry Rain
rode in from his village to the white man’s trading
post.</p>

<p>The old chief purchased a number of articles,
among them some jack-knives and six hatchets.
The hatchets were for his six grandsons.</p>

<p>The trader packed all the purchases in a big
bundle. Dry Rain paid for them, mounted his
pony, and rode home to his village.</p>

<p>When he opened his package, he noticed
that the trader by mistake had put in seven
hatchets.</p>

<p>But Dry Rain said nothing. “That extra
one will do for me,” he thought. “The white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
men stole the Indian’s land and never gave it
back; I will keep the hatchet.”</p>

<p>At the same time he did not feel that this would
be doing just right.</p>

<p>In his wigwam that night he lay half-asleep
and half-awake, thinking about the hatchet.</p>

<p>He seemed to hear two voices talking, in a tone
so earnest that it sounded almost quarrelsome.</p>

<p>“Take back the hatchet,” said one voice.
“It belongs to the white man.”</p>

<p>“No! do not take it back,” said the other
voice. “It is right for you to keep it.”</p>

<p>Back and forth the voices argued and argued,
for hours it seemed to the old chief.</p>

<p>“Take it back!” “Keep it!” “Take it
back!” “Keep it!” “Take it back!”</p>

<p>At last he could stand the dispute no longer,
and sat up in bed wide awake.</p>

<p>“Stop talking, both of you,” he commanded.
“Dry Rain will take back the hatchet in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Then he lay down again, pulled the blanket
over his head, and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>At daylight he arose, mounted his pony, rode
back to the trading post, and returned the hatchet
to the trader.</p>

<p>“Why did you bring it back?” asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
trader. “I had not missed it, and perhaps never
should have known you had it.”</p>

<p>“But Dry Rain would know,” replied the
old chief. “The two men inside of him talked
and quarreled about it all night! One said,
‘Take it back!’ the other said, ‘No, keep it.’
Now they will keep still and let him sleep.”</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Do you think that most white men set the Indians a good
example in being honest?</p>

<p>Dry Rain wanted very much to have the extra hatchet,
didn’t he?</p>

<p>But was he comfortable when he decided to keep it?</p>

<p>Do you think the white trader would ever have found
out?</p>

<p>But who would have known?</p>

<p>Did two voices inside of you ever talk when you were
tempted to keep something which didn’t belong to you?</p></div>

<h2>THE SEVEN CRANBERRIES</h2>


<p>Mr. Dingle was not looking toward Helen.
He was busy grinding coffee in another part of
the store.</p>

<p>How pretty the bright red cranberries looked!
Helen wished she had some.</p>

<p>Her little hand crept over the edge of the
barrel, and very quickly seven bright shining
cranberries were in Helen’s pocket.</p>

<p>“What can I get for you, little girl?” asked
the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“A pound of butter, please,” Helen answered.
She did not look him in the eye; instead, she
looked out of the window.</p>

<p>It took Helen but a short time to reach home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>She laid the butter on the table and put the
seven cranberries in a cup.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they pretty!” she whispered. “I
think I’ll play they are marbles.”</p>

<p>She found a piece of chalk and drew a circle
on the floor. Then she began the game.</p>

<p>“What pretty bright cranberries!” exclaimed
her mother coming into the room. “Where
did you get them, dear?”</p>

<p>How Helen wished that her mother had not
asked that question.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Dingle give them to you?” her
mother asked.</p>

<p>How Helen wished she could say yes! “But
after all,” she thought, “that was not stealing,
so I’ll just tell mother. She knows I would not
steal.”</p>

<p>“No, mother,” she answered, shaking her
head. “I took them out of the barrel.”</p>

<p>“You did!” exclaimed her mother. “Why,
my dear, did you not know that was wrong?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take many—only seven,” Helen
said; “and Mr. Dingle had thousands and thousands
of them!”</p>

<p>“Come here, dear, and sit on my knee,” said
her mother. “I want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>When Helen came she asked, “When you took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the cranberries, was Mr. Dingle looking toward
you?”</p>

<p>“No, he was busy,” answered Helen.</p>

<p>“Would you have taken them if he had been
looking at you?”</p>

<p>Helen hung her head.</p>

<p>“I do not think you would, dear,” said her
mother. “Of course, you did not think for
a moment of stealing from Mr. Dingle.”</p>

<p>“I will never do such a thing again, mother,”
promised the little girl. “I am sorry.”</p>

<p>“Are you sorry enough to take those berries
back, and tell Mr. Dingle what you did?” asked
her mother.</p>

<p>That was quite different from being sorry in
their own kitchen.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, I don’t want to do that!” said
Helen, tears coming into her eyes.</p>

<p>“That is because you are ashamed, Helen,”
said her mother; “but I hope you will always be
brave enough to do the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Will you go with me to the store, mother?”
asked Helen.</p>

<p>“No,” said her mother, “I want you to go
by yourself. But I can help you this much: I
can telephone Mr. Dingle that you are coming.”</p>

<p>Helen sighed. “I wish I had been, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
back again,” she said, picking up the pretty
berries.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said Mr. Dingle, when Helen
handed him the berries, “it takes a pretty brave
girl to own up. If you were a boy, little girl,
I would ask you to come and work for me this
next vacation.”</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Why do you think Helen felt so uncomfortable when she
was asking for the butter, and later when her mother asked
her where she got the cranberries?</p>

<p>Do you suppose Mr. Dingle would ever have known about
the seven cranberries?</p>

<p>But who would always have known?</p>

<p>Why was it that Helen did not think taking the cranberries
was really “stealing”?</p>

<p>What did Helen’s mother think about it?</p>

<p>What do you think about taking even the smallest thing
that doesn’t belong to you?</p></div>

<h2>THE DONKEY’S TAIL</h2>


<p>“Can you see?” asked Hilda Wells, as she
tied the handkerchief over Fred Warren’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You might make it a little tighter,” answered
Fred.</p>

<p>So Hilda tightened the blindfolder.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll turn you around three times,
start you straight,—and you pin the tail on the
donkey,” she said.</p>

<p>The “donkey” was a large picture of that
animal fastened to the wall at the opposite side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the room. It was minus its paper tail, which
Fred held in his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you peep!” cried all the children.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if he can do better than I did!” declared
Frank Bennett. So far the prize belonged
to Frank. Fred’s turn came last.</p>

<p>After being turned around three times, Fred
walked straight up to the picture and pinned the
tail exactly in place.</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, that is better than you did by
two inches!” said Hilda.</p>

<p>“Fred gets the prize!” cried the excited children,
as Fred pulled off the handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then little Marie, Hilda’s sister, handed him
a pearl-handled penknife.</p>

<p>Fred made little of his prize, and as soon as
the children stopped examining it, slipped it
into his pocket.</p>

<p>After that, Mrs. Wells served ice-cream and
cakes.</p>

<p>Oh the way home Frank asked Fred to let him
see the prize. “It is a beauty of a knife, Fred,”
said he. “Until you tried, I thought I should
be the winner.”</p>

<p>Fred muttered something about having too
many knives already.</p>

<p>Frank opened his eyes wide in surprise. “Too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
many!” he exclaimed. “I wish I had too many!
I’ve never had more than one, and that was father’s
when he was a boy.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Frank,” said Fred, suddenly
swinging into a side street. “I am going to take
a short cut home.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Fred,” called Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s a queer way for a fellow to act,” he
thought, as he walked on alone. “I wonder what
is the matter with him.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard footsteps, and in a moment
Fred had caught up with him. “Here,
take it, I don’t want another knife,” he said,
thrusting the prize into Frank’s hand.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh, I don’t want your knife!” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want it, either!” said Fred.
“It belongs to you, anyway; and I believe
you know it! I am almost certain you could
see me peeping from under that handkerchief!”</p>

<p>“I was not quite sure,” said Frank; “not
sure enough to say anything about it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t keep the knife I’ll throw it
into the river,” said Fred, running away as fast
as he could.</p>

<h2>HURTING A GOOD FRIEND</h2>


<p>This is the story of a boy who ruined a good
book. A good book is always a good friend.</p>

<p>He did not mean to—oh, no! But what of
that—he did it, as you may read.</p>

<p>His name was Max Green. One day Max borrowed
a book from Tom Brown, a fine new book
with a picture of a submarine on the cover. Tom
had just received it as a birthday present from
his uncle.</p>

<p>That night Max sat down in a corner to read it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Soon he came to the place where the submarine
was getting ready to fire a torpedo.</p>

<p>“Squeak!” went the book, as Max gave it
a twist in his excitement. He did not hear the
sound; he only saw the torpedo skimming
through the water.</p>

<p>“Crack!” went the book, as Max gave it a
heavier twist. He did not notice that he was
bending the covers farther back. He only knew
that the torpedo was striking the bow of a big
man-of-war.</p>

<p>“Rip!” went the book down the middle, as
Max gave it a harder twist with his hand.</p>

<p>But Max read right on, for just then the man-of-war
lurched over on its side as if it was getting
ready to sink.</p>

<p>In his excitement Max forgot all about what
he was doing and twisted and bent the book back,
cover to cover.</p>

<p>“Stop—quick—oh! oh! It hurts! You have
broken my back—broken my back! Oh!—oh!”
cried the book.</p>

<p>Suddenly Max woke up and saw what he had
done—but it was too late. He had broken the
glue and stitches apart and the covers hung limp.</p>

<p>Just then his mother came in.</p>

<p>“Look, mother—see what I have done to Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Brown’s book,” he confessed. “I am so sorry.
It is such a good book. Can’t we glue it together
again?”</p>

<p>“No,” said his mother, “it is ruined. Glue
may help, but it will never be the same book.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry!” said Max.</p>

<p>“Yes, Max, but being sorry will not make this
book as good as it was when you borrowed it.”</p>

<p>“I will make it right with Tom, mother. I
will take my birthday money to buy him a new
one.”</p>

<p>“That is the right thing to do, Max,”
answered his mother.</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>How is a good book a good friend?</p>

<p>Suppose it had been his own book that Max ruined,
would he have been treating it fairly?</p>

<p>If you were a book, how would you want to be treated?</p>

<p>Do you know what holds a book together? Tell what
you know about the way a book is made.</p>

<p>Why should we be so careful of books?</p></div>

<h2>A SCHOOL WITHOUT A TEACHER</h2>

<h3>What Might Happen if Books and Bells Could Talk</h3>


<p>The little schoolhouse was painted white, with
green shutters. Over the front gable was a little
old-fashioned belfry. In it swung a little old-fashioned
school bell, for this was a country
district school, with scarcely a house in sight.</p>

<p>One bright September morning, the opening
day of school, forty or fifty noisy children were
drawn up in line, waiting for the bell to stop
ringing.</p>

<p>When the bell stopped, the children marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
inside and took their seats facing the teacher’s
desk.</p>

<p>“Order!” tapped the desk bell, and the room
was suddenly still.</p>

<p>The pupils looked to see who had tapped the
bell, for the teacher was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>They saw the new school-books piled on the
platform and on the teacher’s desk—but where
was the teacher?</p>

<p>“I am the new Spelling Book, full of hard
words,” said the top book of the pile of spellers
on the right-hand side of the platform.</p>

<p>“I am the new Reader, full of good stories,”
announced the top one of a stack of readers on
the left-hand side of the platform.</p>

<p>The pupils were startled. It was so quiet you
could hear the clock tick.</p>

<p>“I am the new Arithmetic, full of problems
harder to crack than the hickory nuts in the
woods,” spoke up a book on the teacher’s desk;
“but why don’t you find your teacher?”</p>

<p>No one answered. The children only sat half-frightened,
wondering what would happen next.</p>

<p>“I am the new Language Book,” declared
another book in the row on the teacher’s desk;
“but who will teach you your mother tongue?”</p>

<p>Everyone was still. Only the clock ticked on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am the Geography; in my pages are maps
of all countries. Who will give you permission
to look?” It was the largest book of all that
asked this question.</p>

<p>The pupils stared opened-eyed over the desk
at the teacher’s empty chair. They saw nothing
but a sunbeam coming in through the window—full
of particles of shining dust.</p>

<p>“There must be somebody hiding,” spoke up
one boy who could stand the strain no longer.</p>

<p>“I am going to see,” said another boy braver
than the rest.</p>

<p>Getting up, he looked behind the desk and in
the closet, but nothing was to be seen, not even
a mouse.</p>

<p>“Let us go out and look for the teacher,” he
cried. With one accord they ran pell-mell out
the door into the playground.</p>

<p>An automobile was coming up the road at top
speed.</p>

<p>“Good morning, boys and girls,” the new
teacher called, as the machine pulled up.</p>

<p>“Good morning, teacher,” they answered
crowding about her.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to be late the first day of school.
There was some trouble at Rockland and the
train was delayed. Mr. Jones drove me over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are glad you are here,” said an older
girl as the machine drove off. “We went in and
took our seats at nine o’clock, thinking you
would come at any minute. All at once something
began to talk. ‘I am the Speller full of hard
words; I am the Arithmetic; I am the Reader;
I am the Geography; where is your teacher?’
the voices said. At first we thought somebody
was hiding, but we could not find anyone. Then
we got frightened and ran out.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that strange?” said the teacher
laughing. “We will go in and see.”</p>

<p>Together they trooped into the schoolroom.
They looked everywhere; nothing had been
moved; everything was just as usual.</p>

<p>The teacher tapped the bell and everyone took
a seat.</p>

<p>“Well, children,” she said smiling, “we have
already learned a very important lesson this
morning, and that is that every school must have
a teacher!”</p>

<p>As you came to
school this morning, did you look up
at your flag floating from the top of
the flag pole? Didn’t it look beautiful,
waving and rippling in the sunshine
against the blue sky? I wonder
if you have ever thought
about what it means?</p>

<p>You know flags are signs or emblems,
and they all have a meaning.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/i-067b.jpg" width="85" height="373" alt="boy looking up at flag" />
</div>

<p>There is no reading on our American
flag, yet everyone knows what it
means as certainly as if there were
letters all over it.</p>

<p>Our flag means that the United
States of America is the Land of the
Free, and our government stands for:</p>


<ul>
<li>Liberty and justice for everybody;</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Education for all children;</li>
<li>Protection to all Americans at home or abroad.</li>
</ul>


<p>That is the reason so many people come to
this country from countries where they do not
have such help from the government.</p>

<h2>FLAG DAY</h2>


<p>June 14 is the anniversary of the adoption

<p>We can honor our flag</p>


<ul>
<li>By living for it;</li>
<li>By keeping our own honor bright;</li>
<li>By being brave; (Red stands for valor.)</li>
<li>By being clean; (White stands for purity.)</li>
<li>By being just; (Blue stands for justice.)</li>
<li>By being loyal;</li>
<li>By being ready to die for it, if we are called upon.</li>
</ul>


<p>Our state has one star in the blue of the flag.</p>

<p>How shall we honor our star?</p>

<p>How shall we show respect for our country
and our flag?</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<h2>HOW OUR FLAG DEVELOPED</h2>


<p>The thirteen stripes in our flag represent the
thirteen original colonies.</p>

<p>Every star in the field of blue represents a
state—“A star for every state, and a state for
every star.”</p>

<p>The flag brings a picture to our minds of
all the things we are grateful for in our history,
and of all the things we want our country and
ourselves to be.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>What does our flag mean?</p>

<p>Are you not glad that you live in a country where all
the people rule, instead of any one person or just a few

<p>Can you repeat the Scouts’ Pledge? (Standing.)</p>

<p>Who was Betsy Ross?</p>

<p>Can you form a tableau like the picture of Betsy Ross
sewing the American Flag?</p>

<p>Isn’t it almost as brave to live up to the red, white, and
blue as to die for our colors?</p>

<p>Why is our nation’s flag always hung higher in this
country than the flag of any other nation?</p>

<p>Will you bring pictures of the flags of some other countries
to class?</p>

<p>Do you think any other flag more beautiful than ours?</p>

<p>Will you try to do all you can to honor our flag, and never
to let the star of your state grow dimmer because of any
act of yours?</p></div>

<h2>THE TRUE STORY OF CHEESEY</h2>


<h3>I. The Dog and the Policeman</h3>

<p>One snowy day shortly after Christmas, when
carefully picking my way over the crossing at
Market Street Ferry in Philadelphia, I almost
ran into a big policeman.</p>

<p>Just back of the big policeman was a little
dog, and just back of the little dog was a little
dog-house, and just back of the dog-house was
a beautiful Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Wouldn’t it have made you stop in surprise to
see a dog-house in the middle of the busiest street
in your city or town? Wouldn’t you have wondered
why the big policeman had the little dog,
and why the little dog had such a nice house
there? And wouldn’t you have wondered and
wondered whether the Christmas tree belonged to
the dog or to the big policeman? It made me so
curious that I did just as you would have liked to
do—I asked the policeman to tell me the story.</p>


<h3>II. The Policeman’s Story</h3>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Burke,” I said, for
I knew the officer’s name. “Will you tell me
about the little dog?”</p>

<p>“Why,” answered the policeman with a smile,
“don’t you know about Cheesey? Come here,
Cheesey, the lady wants to see you!”</p>

<p>Cheesey looked up at the speaker and wagged
his tail.</p>

<p>“Cheesey was born on Race Street pier,”
went on the policeman. “Nobody knows how
he got his living after his mother died; but one
thing is sure, he was not treated very kindly by
the men who loaded the boats and swept the
wharves. To this day Cheesey growls at the
sight of one of those men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“After a while Cheesey found a little playmate,
but the playmate was run over by a fire
engine. All night long Cheesey lay in the spot
where his little mate had been killed.</p>

<p>“Weary and lonely and hungry, he crept back
to the old cheerless corner of Race Street pier,
which was the only place he knew as home.</p>

<p>“There he lay with his head on his paws, not
noticing anything until one of the men kicked
him out of the way.</p>

<p>“Cheesey ran out of the pier and down Delaware
Avenue, not knowing where he was going;
but he went just the right way, for he ran into
Officer Weigner, one of the four of us who watch
this crossing.</p>

<p>“He spoke kindly to the little fellow, and gave
him something to eat.</p>

<p>“From that time, Cheesey seemed to think
he belonged to the policemen on this crossing.
Then we gave him his name.”</p>


<h3>III. Cheesey’s Christmas Presents</h3>

<p>“Cheesey had no place to sleep,” went on
the policeman after seeing some people safely
across the street, “except on a pile of bags in the
ferry house. He seemed so cold that I asked
Charley, one of the workmen in the ferry, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
could not knock together some packing boxes
for the little fellow.</p>

<p>“Charley did the best he could, but I must say
he made a sorry looking dog-house.</p>

<p>“One day, just before Christmas while I was
on duty, Mr. Sheip, of the Sheip Box Factory,
happened to notice the box Charley had knocked
together.</p>

<p>“‘Well, well,’ he said, ‘is that the best you
fellows can do?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, Mr. Sheip,’ I replied, ‘we are not
box-makers, you know.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s so!’ he said. ‘I’ll have a dog-house
made in the factory!’ and on Christmas
day this beauty of a dog-house came. Have you
noticed the label on it?”</p>

<p>I read the painted black letters on the large
white label:</p>

<div class="bbox2">
Merry Christmas<br />
to<br />
Cheesey<br />
from<br />
Officers Burke, Dougherty,<br />
Kunzig, and Weigner.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“It pleased us so,” went on the officer, “that
we bought a Christmas tree and many people
helped us trim it.</p>

<p>“A good many people brought presents for
Cheesey. One lady from Camden brought a
feather pillow; another lady brought a piece
of meat. That dog could have seventeen meals
a day if he could hold them—couldn’t you,
Cheesey?”</p>

<p>The little dog wagged his tail, turned around
twice, then went into his house. After thanking
the officer I went on my way, made happier for
all my life because of the true story of Cheesey.</p>

<h2>POOR LITTLE JOCKO</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>On the porch of a comfortable old house,
shaded by fine trees, a group of young girls were
gathered around a small table, sewing.</p>

<p>Suddenly the harsh notes of a hand-organ
came to their ears, disturbing the peaceful stillness
of the summer afternoon.</p>

<p>Marion Johnson, who was visiting her cousins,
laid aside her work and listened.</p>

<p>“Why, I do believe it is the very same man
that came to our town a week ago,” she
exclaimed. “He had with him a poor, miserable
looking monkey, which he called Jocko.”</p>

<p>Just then they saw the organ-grinder, with
the monkey perched on the, organ, coming
up the village street. Seeing the girls on the
porch, he turned up the walk.</p>

<p>“I think I shall call Aunt Kate,” remarked
Marion, rising and going into the house.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate could always be depended upon to
help any dumb creature needing a friend.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate’s face lost its usual look of quiet
good humor, as she glanced over the porch railing
and saw a tall swarthy man at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
steps, carelessly turning the handle of a small
squeaky organ.</p>

<p>Keeping time to the music, a weak little
monkey danced very wearily. When his steps
dragged he was brought up quickly with a sharp
jerking of the chain which was fastened to his
collar.</p>

<p>A cap was held on his head by a tight rubber
band which passed under the chin. His gaudy
dress was heavy and warm and seemed to weigh
down his tired limbs.</p>

<p>Now and then, when he dared, Jocko laid a
tiny brown hand on the tugging chain in an
effort to ease it. With an appealing look he
glanced up at his master, as if trying to make
him understand how painfully the collar was
cutting his thin neck.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Aunt Kate’s mild blue eyes almost flashed as she
motioned to the organ-grinder to stop playing.</p>

<p>“You no lika music?” he asked brokenly,
glancing up at her in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is right,” she answered, speaking
very slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>“We do not like the music; and we do not
like to see that poor monkey dance; and, above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>all, we do not like to see you hurting his neck by
pulling that chain.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="Woman, Jocko and children, organ grinder in background" />
</div>

<p>The look of sullen anger which came over the
man’s face quickly disappeared when he saw
the coin in Aunt Kate’s hand.</p>

<p>“I will give you this,” she said, holding up
the piece of money, “if you will stay here and let
Jocko rest for one hour.”</p>

<p>The organ-grinder smiled and sat down on
the steps as a sign of agreement.</p>

<p>At first, Jocko could scarcely believe that he
might rest his weary little legs and feet. After a
while, however, he threw himself at full length
upon the porch floor as some worn out child
might have done.</p>

<p>Marion was left on guard to see that he was
not disturbed when the others went to get food.</p>

<p>When they returned they found Jocko resting
on a soft cushion, a comfort his little body
had never known before.</p>

<p>Only after being promised more money did
the organ-grinder permit Marion to take off
Jocko’s hard leather collar, underneath which
she had discovered sores.</p>

<p>She bandaged the tiny neck with soft linen
spread with salve. She took off his cap, too,
with its tight-cutting band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>When water was brought, Jocko drank with
pitiful eagerness. Many hours had passed since
he had had a drink, and his throat and lips were
parched. He ate the food they offered him like
a wild creature, for he was very hungry.</p>

<p>Every once in a while he would glance at the
organ-grinder as though he feared punishment.</p>

<p>When the hour was up, the organ-grinder
would stay no longer. As his master led him
away, Jocko lifted his hat, just as if he wanted to
thank Aunt Kate and the girls for their kindness.</p>

<p>“I never knew before,” said Marion, “how
cruel it is to expect little monkeys to live such
unnatural lives. I do hope the man will be more
kind to Jocko after this.”</p>

<h2>ROBIN REDBREAST</h2>


<p>“Cheer up! Cheer up!” sings Robin Redbreast
every morning. “Listen to me! Listen
to me! Oh, excuse me! I see, I see a feast!” and
down he hops, hops, hops to the spot where he
sees a nice fat worm wiggling out of the ground.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is an earthworm, perhaps it is a
worse worm; but if it is an earthworm, you will
have fun watching Robin.</p>

<p>He seizes the worm with his bill, then braces
his feet against the earth, and pulls and pulls
with all his might.</p>

<p>Out comes the worm with such a jerk that
Robin almost topples over; but he doesn’t. He
either eats the worm or flies away with it to his
hungry little birdies.</p>

<p>Down he drops it into one of the wide open
mouths in the nest.</p>

<p>Do you know how many earthworms one baby
robin can eat in one day?</p>

<p>A man who loves birds once counted the
worms that one pair of robins fed to their little
ones, and found that each little robin ate sixty-eight
earthworms in one day.</p>

<p>Sixty-eight earthworms if placed end to end
would measure about fourteen feet. Just think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
what busy lives Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast
live, and how they love their little ones.</p>

<p>Robins eat many other kinds of worms besides
earthworms, and they eat insects, too. They
work hard to feed their babies, and in this way
they do a wonderful thing for us, for the insects
they eat would destroy the plants which we need.</p>

<p>You know bread really grows on tall grasses
called wheat and rye, and oatmeal grows on a
grass called oats.</p>

<p>There are millions of insects which like wheat
and rye and oats as much as we do, and they
would eat up all the crops if it were not for the
birds that eat the insects. Now you can see
why we call the birds our friends.</p>

<h2>WHO KILLED COCK ROBIN?</h2>


<p>Who killed Cock Robin?</p>

<p>No; it was not the sparrow with a bow and
arrow. No—more likely a boy with an air rifle
killed him, or a man with a gun who did not
know what a wicked thing he was doing.</p>

<p>He did not know that he had killed one of
his best friends.</p>

<p>He did not know that without the work of
beautiful Robin Redbreast and other birds the
world might go hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>What if robins do eat a few cherries? They
like mulberries better. A wise farmer plants a
Russian mulberry tree for the robins, and the
mulberries save the cherries.</p>

<h2>MY FRIEND, MR. ROBIN</h2>


<p>When I was only about six years of age, a
Robin Redbreast that we used to feed got so
tame that he would fly in through the window
to our breakfast table.</p>

<p>In the spring he delighted us by bringing
a small family of Roblings to the window sill
of the room as if to introduce them to the
people who had helped him through the hard
winter!</p>

<p>Another special bird that I remember was a
one-legged sparrow that used to be among the
birds that came when we were living in Bucking-ham-shire.
We always called him “Timber-toes.”</p>

<p>He came to us for two or three winters, so
that, even with but one leg, he must have picked
up a living somehow.</p>

<h2>IF ALL THE BIRDS SHOULD DIE</h2>


<p>Now, I want to tell you something that is
worth knowing. It is this. If all the birds
in the world should die, all the boys and girls in
the world would have to die also. There would
not be one boy or girl left alive; they would all
die of starvation.</p>

<p>And the reason is this. Most small birds live
on insects; they eat millions and millions of insects.
If there were no birds, the insects would
increase so that they would eat up all vegetation.
The cattle, and horses, and sheep, and swine, and
poultry would all die, and we should have to die
also.</p>

<p>Now, what I want all of you to remember, is
that every time you kill one of these little
insect-eating birds, it means that thousands of
insects the bird would have eaten are going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
live to torment us; and every time you take an
egg from one of these little birds’ nests, that
means one less bird to eat the insects. I do not
like mosquitoes and insects. I think it is better
that the birds should live and eat the insects,
than that the birds should die and the insects
eat us.</p>

<h2>FURRY</h2>


<p>My house is in a little grove of oak trees.</p>

<p>Every winter I feed several gray squirrels with
nuts.</p>

<p>Every day about noon a big father squirrel
comes and scratches on my kitchen window.</p>

<p>There he sits on the sill, watching with bright
eyes until I open the window and throw out some
nuts.</p>

<p>The more timid squirrels are seated on the
ground looking up at the window. They catch
the nuts and scamper away with them up to
the tops of the trees. But not Furry. He takes
nuts from my hands, and holding them in his
little finger-claws, gnaws away the shell faster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
than I can count ten. He acts quite like a little
pig sometimes, for he asks for more than he needs.</p>

<p>What do you think he does with them?</p>

<p>He jumps down with one in his mouth and
starts to dig. As soon as the hole is deep enough
to suit him he buries the nut, packing the earth
carefully over it to make it look as though the
ground had not been disturbed.</p>

<p>Then back he comes for another nut.</p>

<p>If all the nuts he plants were acorns and he
should forget to come and find half of them
when he is hungry—how big my oak forest
would be!</p>

<h2>THE GROCER’S HORSE</h2>


<h3>I. The Careless Driver</h3>

<p>It was the week before Christmas. Everybody
was ordering all sorts of good things to be sent
home “just as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The grocer’s boy, John, was on duty early.
Soon many baskets were filled with orders to be
delivered.</p>

<p>The horse was hurried out of the stable before
he had quite finished his breakfast, and John
soon had the baskets piled into the wagon.</p>

<p>“Be lively, now,” the grocer said. “Get back
as soon as you can.”</p>

<p>John jumped on the wagon, seized the whip and
gave the horse a sharp cut to begin the day with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>John kept the whip in his hand. If the horse
held up his pace a minute to give himself a chance
to breathe, another snap of the whip kept him
on the run.</p>

<p>At the different houses where he left the groceries
John rushed in and out as quickly as possible.
In several places he was given fresh orders for
articles that were needed.</p>

<p>So the morning passed, and dinner time arrived.
As John put the horse in the stable he could not
help seeing that his breath came hard and fast,
and that he was wet with sweat.</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t do to give him any water,
he is so hot,” John said, as he hurriedly put a
scanty allowance of dry feed into the manger.</p>

<p>The worn-out horse, trembling in every nerve
with the fatigue of going hard all the morning,
was almost choking with thirst.</p>

<p>When John hurried in to his dinner, the first
thing he asked for was something warm to drink.
His mother gave him a cup of hot cocoa, and a
good dinner, which he ate rapidly. Then off he
started for the afternoon’s work.</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” said the grocer as soon as John
appeared. “Get out the horse and take these
baskets; they are all rush orders.”</p>

<p>“I went to Mrs. Bell’s twice this morning,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
said John. “I should think she might give all
her order at one time and not keep us running
there all day.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. She is a good customer.
Hurry up,” answered the grocer.</p>

<p>John ran out to the barn. He certainly had
meant to give the horse water before he started
out again, but being hurried, he forgot it. In
a few minutes, whip in hand, he was urging the
tired, thirsty horse again over the road.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon the horse
began to hang his head. When John touched
him up with the whip he did not go any faster.
When he stopped for the third time at Mrs.
Bell’s house his legs were trembling and he closed
his eyes as if he were going to sleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell looked out of the window and said
to her Aunt Sarah, who was visiting her, “I think
it is a shame for Mr. Rush to let that boy race
his horse so all day. Every time he comes here
the horse is in a sweat, and now he looks as if
he would drop. It is wicked to work a horse so!”</p>

<p>Her aunt replied, “Yes, the horses have to
suffer for man’s thoughtlessness, and woman’s,
too. He’s been here three times to-day, hasn’t
he?” But Mrs. Bell did not see the point of the
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3>II. What Happened in the Barn</h3>

<p>It was seven o’clock before John put the horse
in the stable. He remembered then that he had
given him no water all day. As he did not want
to be obliged to go out to the barn again he gave
him a pail of ice-cold water, which the horse drank
greedily. Then he put his supper before him
and left him.</p>

<p>He did not stop to rub down the aching legs
or to give the faithful, exhausted creature any
further attention. He just threw a blanket over
him and closed the barn for the night.</p>

<p>When John came to the store the next morning
a very angry looking grocer met him at the door.
“You can go home as soon as you like. I won’t
have a boy that drives my horse to death,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Is the horse dead?” asked John, turning pale.</p>

<p>“It is not your fault if he is not dead. I have
been up nearly all night with him, and I must
get another horse to take his place until he is
well.”</p>

<p>“You told me to hurry every time I went out,”
answered John.</p>

<p>“Well, if you had any sense, you would know
when a horse is used up and rest him,” replied
the grocer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse died that day; and the grocer, the
boy driver, and Mrs. Bell were all to blame.</p>

<p>The grocer ought not to have trusted a boy
who had no sympathy for animals. Such a boy
is not fit to drive and care for a horse.</p>

<p>John was too selfish to give the horse time to
breathe or to eat, and he did not care whether
he was made comfortable in the stable or not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell was thoughtless in giving her orders;
so she made the horse take many unnecessary
trips to her house.</p>

<p>So a willing, patient animal was neglected and
worked to death, when with good care he might
have lived many years and done faithful work.
This all happened because the man, the boy, and
the woman had never learned to be thoughtful
and kind.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">To the Lady of the House:</p>

<p>Please order your supplies for the day
early in the morning and all in one order.
One daily trip to your door is enough. Two
trips will wear me out twice as fast.</p>

<p>Telephoning in an extra order doubles the
work for the sales clerk and bookkeeper as
well as for the driver and horse. This adds
to the cost of all you buy.</p>

<p>Hurry up orders make whippings for me.</p>

<p>P. S. Some boys play with a whip over

<h2>A PLEA FOR THE HORSE</h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Every horse will work longer and better if
given three ample meals daily; plenty of
clean, fresh water; proper shoes, sharpened
in slippery weather; a blanket in cold

<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Wouldn’t you have much more work to do if there were
no horses?</p>

<p>Have you ever been very tired?</p>

<p>Have you ever been very thirsty?</p>

<p>Could you ask for a drink of water?</p>

<p>What would a horse say if he could talk?</p>

<p>Can you drive?</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Is the horse a laborer?</p>

<p>Has he a right to wages? What should they be?</p>

<p>How many meals a day should a horse have?</p>

<p>Can you imagine how it would seem if you were very,
very hungry to be taken into a place where tables were
spread with tempting food, and be driven past them without

horse’s mouth, will burn off the skin of the tongue and make
the mouth sore—and perhaps prevent the horse from
eating?</p>

<p>Could the bit be easily warmed by dipping it into hot
water, or breathing on it to take out the frost?</p>

<h2>THE BAKER</h2>


<h3>I. An Early Call</h3>

<p>“Good morning, children,” said Mrs. Duwell,
with a bright smile—so bright that it seemed as
if the oatmeal she was stirring smiled too.</p>

<p>“Good morning, mother,” said Ruth. “My,
but we are early this morning; it is only seven
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, mother,” said Wallace,
sleepily. “May I go back to bed again?”</p>

<p>“Yes—after supper to-night,” replied his
mother. “But I am glad you are up, for I am
expecting a caller to knock at the door any
moment.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, he is a very important man,” said her
mother. “The strange part of it is that he never
rings the front door bell, but always comes to
the kitchen door and knocks.”</p>

<p>“Please tell us who he is!” cried both the
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Mrs. Duwell, “he is going to
bring us the most useful and wonderful article
sold in any store in this city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, tell us what it is,” begged the
children.</p>

<p>Just then there came a heavy knock at the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>“There he comes with it now, I believe,”
whispered Mrs. Duwell. “Wallace, you may
open the door.”</p>

<p>Wallace ran quickly to the door and opened
it, and there stood—the bread man.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” exclaimed Wallace, “it’s only
the bread man!”</p>

<p>“Wallace,” said his mother, “speak more
politely. Say ‘good morning,’ and take a loaf
of bread and a dozen rolls.”</p>

<p>“Now, mother, tell us who it is you expect,
and what he is going to bring,” coaxed Ruth as
soon as the door was closed.</p>

<p>“Sit down and eat your breakfast, children,
and I will tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>When the children had been served, she went
on: “The man I spoke about has just gone—he
is the bread man. Isn’t a loaf of bread the
most useful and wonderful article sold in any
store in the city?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, mother, you are joking!” exclaimed
Wallace.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I am not. Tell me, children,
what must you have in order to live?”</p>

<p>“Food,” replied Ruth.</p>

<p>“Correct; and what article of food do we
most need?”</p>

<p>“Bread,” replied Ruth.</p>

<p>“I believe that is so,” said Wallace, after
thinking a moment. “I am going to talk with
father about it when he comes home to-night.”</p>

<p>“That is right; I think he will tell you something
about wheat fields and bake ovens,” said
Mrs. Duwell. “Now run along to school or
you will be late.”</p>


<h3>II. The Staff of Life</h3>

<p>“Father,” said Wallace, as the family sat
about the supper table that evening, “a very
important man called at the door this morning
before we went to school.”</p>

<p>“He did! Who was he?” asked Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Guess who,” said Ruth. “He left us the
most wonderful and useful article sold in any
store in this city.”</p>

<p>“Who was he? What was it?” Mr. Duwell
pretended to be very curious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess! See if you can guess!”</p>

<p>“Let me see—oh, yes, it must have been the
mayor with a pound of butter.”</p>

<p>“Guess again,” shouted the children.</p>

<p>“A policeman, with a bottle of ink.”</p>

<p>“No, guess again!”</p>

<p>“I give it up.”</p>

<p>“The bread man with that loaf of bread,”
cried the children, pointing to the loaf on the
table.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I believe you are right, children,”
said their father. “I certainly ought to have
guessed, although I never thought of the bread
man as a very important man before.”</p>

<p>“Mother explained it to us this morning
and said that you would tell us about the wheat
fields and bake ovens,” spoke up Ruth.</p>

<p>“I certainly will, children,” said their father,
looking pleased. “Let me see; what is this
made of?” he asked, picking up a piece of
bread.</p>

<p>“Flour.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what kind?”</p>

<p>“Wheat flour.”</p>

<p>“Correct; so this is wheat bread. What
other kinds of bread are there?”</p>

<p>“Rye bread, bran bread, graham bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; and in Europe bread is often made
of oats and barley.”</p>

<p>“Bread is sometimes called by another name,”
said their mother; “did you ever hear of it?
The staff——”</p>

<p>“The staff of life,” finished the children.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” cried their father suddenly.
“The Spotless Bakery is about three squares up
the street. It is open in the evening. I know
the manager. Let us go up there to see how
they make bread.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for dad! Fine, come on!” cried
Wallace.</p>

<p>“I wish mother could go,” Ruth said.</p>

<p>Her mother shook her head; “No, dear, I’ll
not go this time, but thank you for thinking
of it.”</p>

<p>“We won’t be long, mother, and we’ll tell you
about everything when we get home,” said Wallace,
as the three left the house.</p>


<h3>III. A Visit to the Bakery</h3>

<p>Soon they came to a big square building that
seemed to be all windows, blazing with light.
Over the door was a sign which read:</p>

<div class="center">
THE SPOTLESS BAKERY</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The children had often seen the building before
but had never been inside.</p>

<p>They entered and their father asked to see the
manager. Soon he came bustling in—a round
smiling little man, dressed in a spotless white
suit.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Duwell,” he said, shaking
hands.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Baker,” replied Mr.
Duwell. “This is Ruth, and this is Wallace.
They want to see how bread is baked, if you are
not too busy for visitors.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to show you,” said Mr.
Baker, smiling and shaking hands with both
children; “this way, please.”</p>

<p>Up a narrow winding stair they climbed to
the sifting room on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>“Every bit of flour starts on its journey
through these sifters,” said the manager, pointing
to a row of box-like sifting machines.</p>

<p>On the floor stood a huge pile of bags of
flour. “Each one of these bags holds one hundred
and forty pounds,” he explained.</p>

<p>Passing down the stairway they saw the store-room
piled high with more bags of flour. “There
are more than a thousand of them,” said the
manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they came to the mixing room. Everything
was white—the huge mixers were white;
the walls were white; the bakers were dressed in
white with odd round white caps; the dough
trays were white—everything was white and
spotless.</p>

<p>“The flour from the sifters above comes
through an opening in the floor into the mixers.
Then the yeast and other things are added.
The electric power is started. The great iron
arms of the mixers turn, and twist, and mix
until the whole mass becomes dough,” Mr.
Baker explained.</p>

<p>Along the wall were the dough trays in which
the dough is set to rise. These trays remind
one of huge white bath tubs on wheels, a little
wider and deeper and about twice as long as
the ones in our houses.</p>

<p>“How much will each one of those hold?”
asked Wallace, pointing to the trays full of
creamy dough.</p>

<p>“Enough to make eleven hundred loaves,”
answered the manager.</p>

<p>“Why, there must be over forty of them,”
said Wallace, looking down the long line. “How
many loaves do you bake in a day?”</p>

<p>“We have two more bakeries like this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in the three we bake about one hundred thousand
loaves a day—besides rolls and cakes.”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know there was so much bread
in the world,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, there are bakeries almost
everywhere. We supply only a small part of the
bread needed in our large city.”</p>

<p>As they went down the next stairway to the
baking room, the pleasant odor of fresh-baked
bread came up to meet them.</p>

<p>“Here they are!” cried Ruth. “Look, Wallace,
here are the bake ovens!”</p>

<p>All that could be seen on one side of the room
was a long row of black oven doors, set in a low
white-tiled wall.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room were large
oblong tables, around which the white-uniformed
bakers were busily working.</p>

<p>The dough was piled high on the tables. One
baker cut it into lumps. Another made the
lumps into pound loaves, weighing them on a
scale. Another shaped the loaves and put them
into rows of pans, which were slipped into large
racks and wheeled to the oven door.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Wallace, “they are going to
put them in!”</p>

<p>A baker put four loaves on a long-handled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
flat shovel; then quickly opened the oven door
and slipped them inside.</p>

<p>“Look at the loaves!” cried Wallace, peeping
into the open door. “Hundreds of them.
How many will that oven hold?”</p>

<p>“Six hundred,” said the baker, closing the
door.</p>

<p>“Look,” cried Ruth, “they are taking them out
of that other oven. There comes our loaf for
breakfast, Wallace.”</p>

<p>Farther down the room a baker was lifting
out of an oven the nut-brown loaves, bringing
with them the sweet smell of fresh bread.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful!” said Mr. Duwell, who
was almost as excited as the children. “Notice
how all the men work together, everyone doing
his part to help the others.”</p>

<p>“What are the baking hours?” he asked the
manager.</p>

<p>“From twelve o’clock, noon, till midnight, the
ovens are kept going as you see them now,” said
the manager.</p>

<p>“We will go down one more flight to the
shipping room,” he added, leading the way.</p>

<p>There the finished loaves were coming down
from the floor above on great racks to wait
for shipping time. The space in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
shipping platform was crowded with wagons
and automobiles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/i-126.jpg" width="516" height="445" alt="man and children visting commerical baker and watchign men bake loaves of bread" />
</div>

<p>“Why, look!” said Wallace, “there are more
wagons than automobiles. I should think you
would use automobiles entirely.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the manager, “the automobiles
are better for long distances; but for short distances,
where the driver has to start and stop,
horses are much better. When the driver
serves bread along a street he calls, ‘Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Dolly,’ or whatever the horse’s name is, and the
horse follows. The horse is alive; the automobile
isn’t.”</p>

<p>“When does the delivery start?” asked Mr.
Duwell.</p>

<p>“Soon after midnight.”</p>

<p>After thanking the manager for his kindness,
shaking hands all around, and bidding him
good-night, the little party hurried home.</p>

<p>All that night Wallace dreamed that he was
putting loaves of bread into a big oven and lifting
them out, brown and crisp, on the end of a
long-handled shovel, loading them into a delivery
wagon, and driving all over the city, so
that the people could have fresh bread for
breakfast.</p>


<h3>IV. Where the Wheat Comes From</h3>

<p>At the table the next evening the children
were still talking about their visit to the bakery.</p>

<p>“Well, children,” said their father, “we
followed the flour through the bakery to the
loaf on our table. What do you say if we take
a little journey to the place where the wheat
comes from.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Wallace. “When can we
start?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right now, son, but it will be a stay-at-home
journey,” said Mr. Duwell; and everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>“Let us see,” Mr. Duwell went on; “where
did the thousand bags of flour we saw in the
bakery come from?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ruth. “I read ‘Minn.’ on
one of the bags.”</p>

<p>“Good, Ruth,” said her father. “That is
what I call using your eyes. What does ‘Minn.’
stand for?”</p>

<p>“Min-ne-so-ta,” answered Wallace quickly.</p>

<p>“Correct! Minnesota has great wheat fields,
and so have North and South Dakota,
Kansas, and many other states; but the wheat
in our loaf grew in Minnesota.</p>

<p>“Wallace, step over to the bookcase and bring
me the large book marked ‘W.’”</p>

<p>Wallace brought it in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Duwell opened the book and found some
colored pictures.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said he. “What does it say
under the first picture, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“‘Reaping and Binding Wheat,’” read Ruth,
bending over the book.</p>

<p>“Right! There is our loaf growing, and there
is the machine cutting the wheat and tying it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into bundles. What does it say under this picture,
Wallace?”</p>

<p>“‘Threshing by Steam,’” read Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes—taking the wheat from the straw and
chaff. What comes next, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“‘Grain El-e-va-tor,’” read Ruth.</p>

<p>“What is a grain elevator?” asked Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Why, the place where the wheat is stored until
needed.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Duwell, “some elevators are
so large that they will hold nearly two million
bushels of wheat.”</p>

<p>“Plenty large enough to hold our loaf,” added
Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Now read again, Wallace.”</p>

<p>“‘In-te-ri-or of Flour Mill,’” read Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is where they grind the wheat into
white flour and remove the bran.”</p>

<p>“Bran is the outside coat, isn’t it?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it! Now read again.”</p>

<p>“‘Train Being Loaded with Flour,’” read
Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes, that must be a picture of the fifteen
car loads of flour used every week by the Spotless
Bakery.”</p>

<p>“I never would have believed it took so many
people to make a loaf of bread,” exclaimed Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Duwell. “Let me see: the plowman, the sower,
the reaper,—go on, Wallace.”</p>

<h2>THE MILKMAN</h2>


<h3>I. Before the Sun Rises</h3>

<p>“What do you think one of our lessons was
about to-day, mother?” asked Ruth, coming in
from school one afternoon.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t guess,” said her mother. “What
was it about?”</p>

<p>“The milkman.”</p>

<p>“The milkman,” repeated Mrs. Duwell in
surprise; “that must have been interesting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we just talked. Teacher asked questions;
she asked if we liked bread and milk or
cereal and milk, and said that they made an
excellent breakfast.</p>

<p>“What do you think, mother,” Ruth went on;
“teacher told us that not many years ago the
milkman came around with big cans of milk
and measured whatever you wanted, a pint or
a quart, into your pitcher or milk pail.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” said Mrs. Duwell. “That
is the way they did when I was a little girl. How
did they come to change? Did your teacher
tell you?”</p>

<p>“People found that it was not san-i-ta-ry,
teacher said. The milk was not always kept
clean; so the milkmen put it into pint and quart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>bottles, with paper caps to keep out flies and
germs.”</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The next time you drink a glass of milk think about what a long
journey it has taken.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">The milk in the bottle in this picture came in a big can from the
cow to the railroad station, on the train to the city dairy where
it was bottled and tested. It was then sent out in a large auto
truck to the delivery wagon which took it to the duwell family.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Does the milk which you use take as long a journey as that?</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Did you find out where the milk comes
from?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, from the farms. Teacher showed us
pictures of cows; some with tan and white coats—Jerseys;
and some with black and white coats—Holsteins,
I think she said. I should love to
see real cows.”</p>

<p>“So you shall, dear, the next time we go into
the country.</p>

<p>“I remember,” continued Mrs. Duwell, “hearing
your grandfather say that when he was a
boy he had to be out of bed before daylight,
sometimes as early as three o’clock, and go out
into the cold barn to milk the cows.”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock in the morning!” exclaimed
Wallace, who had just come in.</p>

<p>“Yes; then he had to hurry into the kitchen
for breakfast, then out again, hitch up old Dobbin,
load the milk cans on the wagon and drive
to the nearest station to catch the milk train.
He had to do all this by six o’clock—before
most people in the city think of getting up.”</p>

<p>“My, there wasn’t much fun in that,” said
Wallace.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. You remember the deep snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in March last winter. I asked our milkman
what time he started on his rounds. What
do you think he said?”</p>

<p>“Six o’clock,” replied Wallace.</p>

<p>“Earlier than that, son,” said Mrs. Duwell.
“He laughed and said, ‘I have to load up and
start by three o’clock to serve all my customers
before breakfast.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Ruth, “teacher told us about
that and asked what would happen if the driver
overslept and did not get over the route before
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“What did you answer?”</p>

<p>“Why, that we might have to do without
milk for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Or we might have to wait for breakfast until
eleven o’clock,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>“Oh, Wallace,” cried Ruth, “I didn’t say
that! If we waited for breakfast until eleven
o’clock we would be dreadfully late for school.”</p>

<p>“And dreadfully hungry, too,” said Wallace.
“I’m glad our milkman gets up on time.”</p>


<h3>II. Milk, from Farm to Family</h3>

<p>“Well, what I want to know is, where the
Clover Leaf Dairy gets our milk from,” said
Wallace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/i-140.jpg" width="509" height="292" alt="farmer with two milk cans standing in barn doorway" />
</div>

<p>“It is this way. The dairy wagon meets the
milk train and takes the cans of milk to the
dairy. There they test the milk to see if it is pure
and fresh.</p>

<p>“Next they empty the milk into a big white
tank and heat it to kill the disease germs. After
quickly cooling the milk, they put it into bottles,
and it saves the babies’ lives,” said Ruth
almost without stopping to take breath.</p>

<p>Her mother smiled and asked, “Did your
teacher tell you the name of that work?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it was a long word, and I have forgotten
it,” answered Ruth.</p>

<p>“Pas-teur-i-zing.” Her mother said it for
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it—pasteurizing. I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
think. It kills all the bad germs so that the
milk is safe for even the weakest babies.</p>

<p>“Teacher told us about a good man in New
York,” Ruth went on, “named Mr. Straus, who
was sorry because so many babies died from
drinking impure milk. He made it so that
poor babies in New York could have pasteurized
milk; and then less than half as many died as
before.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that a noble thing to do,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes; our teacher says that almost everybody
uses pasteurized milk now, and in this way thousands
of babies’ lives have been saved. She
says that we ought to be grateful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Duwell; “we ought
to be grateful to the milkman, the farmer, and
everybody that helps to bring us pure milk.”</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Would you like to get up long before daylight, on cold
winter mornings to deliver milk for people’s breakfast?</p>

<p>Tell some of the things you like that you could not have
to eat if the milkman did not come.</p>

<p>Have you ever visited a big dairy?</p>

<p>Tell about it.</p>

<p>Imagine you own a herd of cows in the country, and tell
some of the things you would do in order to be sure to send
good, pure, clean milk to the dairy.</p></div>

<h2>THE GROCER</h2>


<h3>I. The Old-time Grocer</h3>

<p>“Wallace, light another candle, please. I
cannot see very well,” said Mr. Duwell as he sat
smiling at the head of the dining table, with
carving knife lifted ready to carve the roast.</p>

<p>Wallace turned on another electric light, and
everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s a good guess, son,” said his mother.
“On my grandfather’s farm they always burned
candles, and grandmother made them herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Made them herself!” exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her mother. “I have often
seen the candle moulds. They looked like a
row of tin tubes fastened together. The wicks
were hung in the middle of the tubes, and the
melted tallow was poured in around them.
When the candles were hard and cold, they
were slipped out ready for use.”</p>

<p>“Your grandmother must have been smart.
What relation was she to me?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“Your great-grandmother, dear. She was
‘smart,’ indeed. She made not only candles,
but soap.”</p>

<p>“Soap!” said Ruth in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, and butter,” said Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Your great-grandfather was ‘smart,’ too,”
said Mr. Duwell. “Why, Wallace, he butchered
a pig or two, and sometimes a cow in the
fall for the winter’s meat.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t there any grocers or butchers?”
asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; your great-grandmother was
the grocer, and your great-grandfather was the
butcher for the family.”</p>

<p>“But weren’t there any stores?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the stores were in the big kitchen pantry,
the cellar, and the ice-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean grocery stores like Parker’s, and
Wiggin’s,” explained Wallace.</p>

<p>“No, until the towns and villages sprang up
there were no stores such as we have now,” said
Mr. Duwell. “You see, there were not many
people to buy things in the early days, and they
lived on farms many miles apart, so it did not
pay anyone to keep a store.</p>

<p>“Why is the grocery so useful to everybody?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Because it sells food.”</p>

<p>“That is it. You see, when enough people
lived in one place to make a village or town,
some one opened a store. Now, how did he
get flour to sell?”</p>

<p>“From the miller.”</p>

<p>“Right—and potatoes?”</p>

<p>“From the farmer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the miller brought flour and the farmer
brought potatoes to the grocer for him to sell.”</p>

<p>“And when grandma made more butter than
she could use she sent it to the grocer,” added
Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Where did the grocer get his stock of brooms,
Ruth?” asked her father.</p>

<p>“From the broom-maker.”</p>

<p>“That is the idea. All who grew or made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
more things than they could use brought them
to the grocer to be sold. So the grocer helped
them and they helped him, and the people went
to the store for their supplies.</p>

<p>“You must remember, children,” went on Mr.
Duwell, “the old-fashioned country store was very
different from Parker’s grocery around the corner.
Besides groceries, it sold harness, horse blankets,
hardware, shoes, and everything people needed.”</p>


<h3>II. The Modern Grocer</h3>

<p>“Suppose Wallace were a grocer, Ruth, how
would you like his store to be kept?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>“Clean—oh, so clean!” replied Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes, what else?”</p>

<p>“Full of shelves with all the packages and
bottles and other things in their places.”</p>

<p>“How would you treat the people, Wallace?”
asked Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“I would be very polite, and try to have every
article they wanted fresh and good.”</p>

<p>“That is right, and I know you would be
honest and truthful.”</p>

<p>“If you were that kind of grocer, Wallace,”
said Mr. Duwell, “you would be of real service
to the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“What kind of customers would you like to
have, Wallace?” asked Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Oh, people who paid their bills on time and
didn’t find too much fault,” answered Wallace.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ruth, “if you were anything
like that, your customers would certainly call
you The Spotless Grocer.”</p>

grocer besides paying your bills promptly?</p></div>

<h2>STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HELP<br />
CLOTHE US</h2>




<h2>THE TAILOR</h2>


<h3>I. The Accident</h3>

<p>Wallace was very proud of the new suit of
clothes his father had just bought him. He
wanted to wear it to school the first day after
it came home.</p>

<p>“If I were you I should keep it for best for a
while, Wallace,” said his mother. “Your old
suit is good enough for school for some time.”</p>

<p>“But Tom Dolittle is going to wear his new
suit to-day; he told me so.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem wise to me, Wallace—but
wear it if you think best.”</p>

<p>“All right, mother,” said Wallace as he
skipped away to put it on.</p>

<p>A few minutes later his mother stood watching
a very happy boy running down the street.</p>

<p>“Mother!” called Wallace, walking slowly
upstairs when he came in from school.</p>

<p>“Here I am, boy, in the sitting room,”
answered his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just see what has happened to my new suit!”</p>

<p>“Have you torn your jacket?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not torn,” he said, coming into the
room. “It is worse than that. I’m afraid it
is ruined. Look! Look!”</p>

<p>“Why, child,” exclaimed Mrs. Duwell, “how
did this happen? Let us go into the bathroom
to wipe off a little of the mud. That may
prevent stains.”</p>

<p>She hardly knew the mud-splashed boy who
stood before her, so very unlike the spick and
span Wallace of the morning.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, don’t worry too much,” she said.
“We will see what the tailor can do for us.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he can make it clean enough
for me to wear?” asked the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think that he can make it look very well,”
said his mother. “Put on your other suit and
we will take this one around to the tailor’s shop.
But you haven’t told me what happened.”</p>

<p>“Why, it was this way: I was chasing some of
the boys, and just as I reached the corner an automobile
came speeding out of West Street. It
skidded into the curb, and splashed the mud
over me from head to foot. The whole thing
happened in less than a minute. You ought
to have heard the boys laugh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am thankful you were not hurt,” said
his mother. “I will put on my wraps and we
will go at once.”</p>


<h3>II. At the Tailor Shop</h3>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Mrs. Duwell to the
tailor as they entered the shop.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said the tailor. “What
can I do for you to-day?”</p>

<p>“We want to see if you can make this suit of
clothes look like new,” said Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Let me look at it,” said the man, untying
the parcel, and examining the mud-splashed
clothing.</p>

<p>“Well, that is pretty bad, but I guess we can
do a good job.”</p>

<p>“How much will you charge?” asked Wallace
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five cents, if you call for it,” said the
tailor, taking out a tag. “What name, please?”</p>

<p>“Give your name, son,” said Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Wallace Duwell,” said the boy. “When
may I come?”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow,” replied the tailor.
“We will do our best to make it look like new.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Wallace, smiling for
the first time since the accident.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Mrs. Duwell, as they
left the shop.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” answered the tailor; “come
again.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Wallace, after they had walked
a few minutes, “it was my fault that this accident
happened, and I want to pay for having
the suit cleaned. I have the money Aunt Mary
gave me for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“That will please your father, Wallace. We
will tell him the whole story this evening.”</p>


<h3>III. What the Tailor Saved the Duwell Family</h3>

<p>When Wallace finished telling about the accident
his father said, “I wonder how much money
the tailor is saving us by doing this work?”</p>

<p>“I never thought about that,” admitted Wallace.</p>

<p>“Let me see. We paid seven dollars and a
half for that suit, didn’t we, mother?” asked
Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that was the amount,” answered
Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Well, if the suit couldn’t be cleaned it would
mean that we should have to buy another in its
place. Mother can clean a suit well, but even
she could not make as sorry a looking suit as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
yours look like new. Now do a little problem
in arithmetic.”</p>

<p>Wallace promptly pulled pad and pencil
from his pocket, and wrote:</p>


<div class="bbox2">
<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="savings of tailoring">
<tr><td align="left">Cost of suit</td>
<td align="right">$7.50</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Saved</td>
<td align="right">$6.75</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Six dollars and seventy-five cents! I didn’t
think it would be that much!” he exclaimed in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Be sure to thank the tailor when you go
after your suit,” said Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” said Wallace.</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Do you ever visit the tailor’s?</p>

<p>Tell about his shop.</p>

<p>Do you think his work is easy? Could you do it?</p>

<p>If you were a tailor and had worked hard to do good,
prompt work, how would you like to be treated in return?</p>

<p>If your suit could talk about all the things that happened
to it before it came to you, it would tell a very interesting
story. Pretend you are a suit and tell all about yourself.</p></div>

<h2>THE DRESSMAKER</h2>


<h3>I. An Invitation to a Party</h3>

<p>“Mother,” said Ruth, coming in from school
a few days later, “Mildred Maydole has invited
me to her birthday party. She wrote the invitations
herself on the prettiest little note paper.
Here is mine.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Duwell read:.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">Dear Ruth,</p>

<p>It will give my mother and me much pleasure
if you will come to my birthday party from three
to six o’clock, Saturday afternoon, January
twenty-eighth.</p>

<div class="sig"><span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your friend,</span><br />
Mildred Maydole.<br />
</div></div>

<p>“Oh, mother, please say I may go!” cried Ruth
excitedly, jumping up and down on tiptoe. “Mildred
wants an answer soon, so that her mother
can make her plans.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, I think you may go,” said her
mother, “if I can get your new dress made by the
twenty-eighth. You have grown so fast that
I have not been able to keep up with you in
sewing.”</p>

<p>“I am so happy with the thought of going,”
exclaimed Ruth, “that I can scarcely wait for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the day. You know, mother, Mildred is older
than I, and it is a great honor to be invited to
her party.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, it is,” agreed her mother. “Naturally
Mildred could not invite all the children in
your grade at school; so if I were you I would not
talk about the party before the other children.
You see, it might hurt the feelings of some who
were not invited.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Mildred said, mother; she
asked us to keep it a secret for that reason.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, if you do keep it secret, do not
make a mystery of it, whispering among the
fortunate ones and letting the others wonder why
you all say, ‘Hush,’ when they happen to come
near.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother! how did you know?” asked
Ruth flushing. “Now that I think of it, that is
just what we did do.”</p>

<p>“Instead of just telling Mildred that you will
come,” said her mother, “I think it would be
better to write a note accepting the invitation.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it right away!” exclaimed Ruth, running
to her little desk. “Will you help me with
the words?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Duwell. “How would it
do to say this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">Dear Mildred,</p>

<p>My mother is very much pleased with the kind
invitation to your birthday party, and says that
I may come on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your friend,</span><br />
Ruth Duwell.”<br />
</div></div>

<p>When Ruth had finished writing, she sealed
the envelope.</p>

<p>“I shall hand this to Mildred after school is
dismissed at noon,” she said. “Thank you for
helping me, mother.”</p>


<h3>II. A Disappointment</h3>

<p>Mrs. Duwell had been unusually busy for
several days after the conversation about the
party.</p>

<p>One day she said, “Ruth, dear child, I cannot
seem to find time to make your new dress. I
wonder if Miss Fells could make it before the
twenty-eighth. Why not run over and ask her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, why not? I think that is a
good idea,” agreed Ruth.</p>

<p>“I do, too,” said her mother. “Here is the
material that grandma sent you. Run along,
and do not forget to thank Miss Fells if she will
agree to make your dress.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, mother, I won’t,” said Ruth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3>III. At the Dressmaker’s</h3>

<p>“Good afternoon, Miss Fells,” said Ruth, when
she entered the door of the dressmaker’s house.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Ruth,” said Miss Fells, who
knew the little girl. Then, noticing the package,
she added, “Oh, I hope you are not going to ask
me to make you a dress any time soon.”</p>

<p>Ruth’s heart sank. “I was going to, Miss
Fells,” she admitted.</p>

<p>“How soon?” asked the dressmaker.</p>

<p>“By January the twenty-eighth.” Then she
told about the party and her mother’s disappointment.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can do it—” began Miss
Fells. Then seeing the tears in Ruth’s eyes, she
said, “But let me look at the goods, Ruth.”</p>

<p>The little girl spread the material out on the
table.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty!” exclaimed Miss Fells. “Perhaps
I can get some extra help. Come for a fitting
to-morrow at four o’clock, and we’ll see what
can be done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you, Miss Fells!”
Ruth exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then she ran all the way home to tell the good
news.</p>

</div>

<p>“Now we see, Ruth,” said her mother, “how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a><br /><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
glad we should be that different people do different
things for us. A person who studies and
works in one special line must do better than one
who works at it only once in a while—the way I
do dressmaking.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is true, mother,” exclaimed Ruth,
“I never thought of it before, though.”</p>

<p>“There are many more things to be learned
about dressmakers,” went on her mother. “Let
us talk about some of them this evening.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I suppose father will ask a lot of
questions—just as he did about the tailor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Duwell, “and
I am glad that you are interested. I have heard
my grandmother say that when she was young,
there were no ready-made paper patterns.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother, how could people make dresses
then?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“It was done in this way. A seamstress or
some one who liked to make dresses would cut
out and fit a dress for somebody in her family or
neighborhood. If the dress was pretty, the pattern
would be borrowed and used by almost the
entire village.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t people mind if other dresses were made
just like theirs?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“No,” said her mother, “styles did not change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
quickly in those days. Indeed, the getting of a
new dress was a great event in the life of a girl,
and it was chosen most carefully.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px;">
<img src="images/i-161.jpg" width="538" height="455" alt="in new dress" />
</div>

<p>“You see, it served first as a best dress; then,
being turned, it often served as second best.
After that, perhaps it would be handed down to
a younger child to be worn as long as it had
been by its first owner.”</p>

<p>“My,” cried Ruth. “I am glad I didn’t live
in the days when new dresses were so scarce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Duwell smiled. “Children to-day have
more of everything than children ever had before.
They have more clothes and playthings, and better
chances for ed-u-ca-tion—but here comes your
father, Ruth. You may run and tell him of
our plan for the evening.”</p>

<p>Mr. Duwell was very much pleased with
the plan. When the evening came he asked
and answered many questions. He then showed
the children pictures of silkworms in a large
book marked “S.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” he asked, “do you know that
we have silkworms right here in America? The
American silkworms spin silk as strong and
beautiful as that of the Chinese silkworms.
But the people here do not have the time or
patience to grow silkworms.”</p>


<h3>IV. The Party</h3>

<p>Ruth’s dress was not finished until an hour
before the party began.</p>

<p>As soon as the last stitch was taken,
Miss Fells herself carried it to the Duwell
home.</p>

<p>Ruth was “on pins and needles” for fear it
would not be done in time, and she was
delighted to see the dressmaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Fells, I cannot thank you enough
for getting it done!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Hurry and put your dress on,” said Miss
Fells. “I want to see how it fits.”</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell, Ruth was
dressed.</p>

<p>“It fits perfectly,” said Miss Fells, who was
almost as happy as Ruth herself.</p>

<p>“It certainly does,” said Mrs. Duwell. “It is
just right.”</p>

<p>Mildred was very glad when Ruth arrived at
the party, for she knew of her worry about the
dress.</p>

<p>“It is beautiful, Ruth,” she said, looking with
sparkling eyes at the pretty smocking on the
waist and skirt. “Miss Fells told me she was
going to surprise you,” she added.</p>

<p>“She surely did surprise me. Wasn’t she
kind!” replied Ruth.</p>

<p>The party was a delight. One of the games was
a contest in needle threading. Ruth threaded
her needle in the shortest time and won the prize,
a pretty silver thimble.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the new dress helped you to win,”
said Mildred.</p>

<p>“Won’t Miss Fells be pleased when she hears
about it,” said Ruth.</p>

<h2>THE SHOEMAKER</h2>


<h3>I. The Worn Shoes</h3>

<p>“Where now, Wallace?” asked Mr. Duwell as
he met his son one bright afternoon.</p>

<p>The boy was carrying a bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>“Mother sent me over to the shoemaker’s,”
replied the boy.</p>

<p>“I am glad I ran across you,” said Mr.
Duwell; “I have an errand over in that direction;
I’ll walk along with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, father. Mother said she wished
she could ask you about my shoes. We could
not make up our minds whether they were worth
half-soling or not.”</p>

<p>“Why not talk the matter over with the shoemaker?”
said Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shouldn’t have let them get so
worn before taking them to Mr. Shoemaker’s,”
remarked Wallace.</p>

<p>“As mother says, ‘A stitch in time saves nine,’”
remarked Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>“By the way, father,” continued Wallace,
“isn’t Mr. Shoemaker’s name a good one for a
cobbler?”</p>

<p>Mr. Duwell smiled. “Very good, indeed; but
really it isn’t so strange as it seems. Many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
ago, when people did not have two names, they
became known by the names of the trades they
followed. For instance, John the baker became
John Baker, and later Mr. Baker; so also the
tailor became Mr. Taylor; the mason, Mr. Mason;
the carpenter, Mr. Carpenter.”</p>

<p>“And the blacksmith, Mr. Smith; and the
cook, Mr. Cook,” added Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his father, “and we could think of
many more such names; but here we are at Mr.
Shoemaker’s. Suppose you attend to this little
matter of business by yourself, while I do my
errand.”</p>

<p>This made Wallace look pleased and important
as he stepped into the shop.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Shoemaker,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” replied the shoemaker;
“what can I do for you to-day?”</p>

<p>Wallace handed him the parcel, which he
opened.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would pay to put half-soles
and new heels on these shoes?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Pretty good uppers,” replied the shoemaker,
examining them carefully. “I think it would
almost double the length of life of these shoes to
mend them, but I would not wear the next pair
quite so long before having them mended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said Wallace. “How
much will you charge?”</p>

<p>“A dollar and a quarter for soles and heels,”
replied the man.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a good deal?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Not too much if we use the best quality of
leather, and it doesn’t pay to use any other.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Shoemaker,” agreed Wallace.
“When shall I call for them?”</p>

<p>“On Saturday,” he replied, writing Wallace’s
name on a tag.</p>

<p>“Very well, good afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the shoemaker.</p>

<p>Outside the door Wallace was joined by his
father.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether I did right to leave my
shoes, father,” said Wallace. “Mr. Shoemaker
said the charge would be a dollar and a quarter.
Doesn’t that seem a big price?”</p>

<p>“It does,” replied Mr. Duwell, “but I think you
did right. A new pair of such shoes would cost
three dollars and seventy-five cents.”</p>

<p>“And three dollars and seventy-five cents, less
one dollar and a quarter, equals two dollars and
a half saved,” finished Wallace.</p>

<p>“That is true, my boy,” said Mr. Duwell, “if
they last as long as a new pair.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to be very much obliged
to the shoemaker, even though we do pay him
for his work,” mused the boy aloud.</p>

<p>“So we should,” said his father. “Everyone
who does good work helps the world along,
whether he is paid for it or not.”</p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t want to be a shoemaker,”
went on Wallace.</p>

<p>“Why not, Wallace?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hardly know, father.”</p>

<p>“Shoemaking is very interesting, and it requires
skill, my boy. Of course, the making
of new shoes does not require the skill it did
years ago because so much of the work is done
by machines.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a shoemaker who became
a great man?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is the question, is it?” said Mr.
Duwell with a smile. “I have heard of several,
and this evening I shall be glad to talk about
them.”</p>


<h3>II. Shoemakers Who Became Famous</h3>

<p>That evening, when the family was seated
around the library table, Mr. Duwell brought
out a book and took up Wallace’s question.</p>

<p>“Here is a book,” he said, “that tells many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
facts about shoemakers who became noted men.
Let me read about some of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘One of our most famous American poets,
John Greenleaf Whittier, in early life, was a shoemaker.
Whittier never forgot the lessons he
learned while working at the shoemaker’s bench.
His book of poems, called Songs of Labor,
printed in 1850, contains a stirring poem about
shoemakers.’</p></div>

<p>“Here are two other famous men,” said Mr.
Duwell, turning the page he was reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Among noted Americans who were shoemakers
was Roger Sherman, of Con-nec-ti-cut.
He was a member of the Congress of 1774.
Sherman was one of the brave men who signed
the Dec-lar-a-tion of In-de-pen-dence.</p>

<p>“‘At least one vice-president of the United
States was a shoemaker—Henry Wilson, who
was made vice-president when General Grant
became president in 1872. He was often called
“the Na-tick Cobbler,” because he was once a
shoemaker in the town of Natick.’</p></div>

<p>“So you see, Wallace,” Mr. Duwell went on
after a little pause, “the kind of work you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
doesn’t matter so much. It is how well you do
it that makes the difference.”</p>

<p>“I think I do see, father,” said Wallace.
“Maybe, after all, I’ll be a shoemaker. Then,
perhaps, I’ll become a poet or vice-president of
the United States.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather be a tailor?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I should stand as good a chance
then,” replied Wallace.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure,” said Mr. Duwell laughing.
“Andrew Johnson was a tailor, and he
became President of the United States; but all
mother and I hope for, son, is that you will
become a useful, well-educated man.”</p>


<h3>III. At the Shoemaker’s Shop</h3>

<p>When he called for his shoes on Saturday, Wallace
looked at the shoemaker with new respect.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Shoemaker,” said Wallace.
“Are my shoes ready?”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” replied the shoemaker.
“Yes, here they are.”</p>

<p>“They look fine!” exclaimed the boy. “Thank
you for doing such a good job. Here is the
money—a dollar and a quarter—is that right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, thank you,” replied the shoemaker. “It
isn’t every day that a customer thanks me for
doing a good job. Most people don’t give a
thought to anything but finding fault if the
work isn’t right—especially boys.”</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Is there a shoemaker’s shop near your home?</p>

<p>Did the shoemaker ever save you or your family any
money?</p>

<p>Can you tell about him and his shop?</p>

<p>What kind of customers do you think he likes?</p>

<p>See if you can make a list of the people whom you have to
thank for a new pair of shoes.</p></div>

<h2>THE CARPENTER</h2>


<h3>I. A Trip into the Country</h3>

<p>“It’s just possible that I may be home very
early, perhaps in time for twelve o’clock lunch,”
remarked Mr. Duwell, one Saturday morning
as he was starting for business.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t that be fine!” exclaimed the
children. “We’ll be looking for you.”</p>

<p>Even before the noon whistles had ceased blowing,
three eager faces were peering out of the windows,
for Mrs. Duwell was as interested as Ruth
and Wallace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope father will come soon!” exclaimed
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I am sure to see him first,” said Wallace
with a superior air. “I can see farther than
you!”</p>

<p>“You can’t see father any better than I can,”
replied Ruth, “for I see him this minute.”</p>

<p>“You do? Where?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“I certainly do—may I run to meet him,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see him!” cried Wallace. “I am going,
too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, run!” said Mrs. Duwell. “You both
have better eyes than I have.” Almost before
she had finished speaking, the children were racing
toward a carriage. As the driver drew rein,
they climbed in.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are!” Mr. Duwell sang out, as
they drove up in front of the door. “What does
the Duwell family say to a ride this pleasant
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“What a grand surprise!” called Mrs. Duwell,
who was now standing on the top step.</p>

<p>“I am going to get an apple for the horse,”
cried Wallace, and away he ran. In a moment
he returned.</p>

<p>“How does that taste, old fellow?” he asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
rubbing the horse’s soft nose as he munched the
apple.</p>

<p>“He isn’t really hungry,” said Mr. Duwell.
“He had his dinner just before we left the livery
stable, and the stable man gave me a bag of grain
for his supper; but I guess he doesn’t often get
apples.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take long to eat lunch that day, the
family were so excited.</p>

<p>“Where are we going, father?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Just into the country,” said Mr. Duwell.
“It has been so long since we have seen the
green fields that I thought a trip would do us
all good.”</p>

<p>Soon they left the city streets behind, and came
to a beautiful country road, along which they
drove for several miles.</p>

<p>“Oh, see that funny-looking house!” exclaimed
Ruth suddenly. “It looks like a cage!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a house, yet,” said Mr. Duwell;
“it is only the frame-work.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Wallace, “is that the way
wooden houses are built?”</p>

<p>“It is, little city people,” replied Mr. Duwell.
“No wonder you are not familiar with such a
sight. City houses are not built of wood, because
of the danger of fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to see that house closer,” said
Wallace.</p>

<p>“We’ll drive over there,” his father agreed,
turning the horse’s head.</p>

<p>As they drew near, Wallace exclaimed, “Why,
there’s Mr. Emerson on the porch; he is my
teacher. I wonder what he is doing here.”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Emerson saw the boy.
“Good afternoon, Wallace,” he said, lifting his
hat and bowing to the party as he came toward
the carriage.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Emerson,” said Wallace,
lifting his cap; “I should like to have you
meet my mother and father.”</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson bowed, and shook hands with
Mr. and Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“And this is Wallace’s sister, Ruth,” said Mr.
Duwell.</p>

<p>“I am glad to know you, Ruth,” Mr. Emerson
said. “Are you thinking of moving into the
country?” he asked after a minute. “If so; I
hope you will be my neighbors.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here, Mr. Emerson?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Mr. Emerson, smiling;
“but we hope to when the new house is
finished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a comfortable home it will be,” said
Mr. Duwell.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson looked pleased. “Won’t you
come in and see the plan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Thank you, we shall be delighted to,” said
Mr. Duwell.</p>


<h3>II. The Sawmill</h3>

<p>After they had gone all over the house, they
bade Mr. Emerson good-by and drove away.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be fine! How I should love to live
there!” The children were still talking about the
new house.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose Mr. Emerson got the
wood?” questioned Ruth.</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Wallace; “at the lumber
yard.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/i-178.jpg" width="510" height="235" alt="men walking on logs in river" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he, father? Couldn’t he have just
chopped down some of those trees over there?”
asked Ruth, pointing to a wooded hill to the
right.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” replied Mr. Duwell. “Before
trees can be used in building they have to
be—”</p>

<p>“Sawed into boards and planks,” finished Wallace.</p>

<p>“Good!” said his father. “And where is that
done?”</p>

<p>“At the sawmill,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“That reminds me—” said Mrs. Duwell; “there
is a sawmill over at the bottom of that hill. Mr.
Emerson told me about it. Some of his lumber
came from there.”</p>

<p>“Then this road must lead to it,” said Mr. Duwell,
pulling up at a cross-road that ran through
the woods towards the hill.</p>

<p>“What does that sign-post say, Wallace?”</p>

<p>Wallace jumped out and examined the dingy
sign, which was hardly readable.</p>

<p>“Sawmill Road; this is the right way!” he cried.</p>

<p>They had not driven far along the shady road
when a peculiar, whistling sound met their ears.</p>

<p>“There’s the saw, now, I believe!” exclaimed
Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it is,” said Mr. Duwell. “Trot along,
boy!” he urged the horse.</p>

<p>At a turn in the road they came upon
the old sawmill, nestling at the foot of the
hill. The smooth mill pond shone brightly
in the sun. As the water fell over the dam,
it tumbled into a noisy little brook which ran
under a bridge and away down the valley.
The refreshing odor of pine and cedar filled
the air.</p>

<p>Several men were busy sawing the trunk of a
pine tree into long, clean planks. The children
watched the circular saw with wonder as its sharp
teeth ate into the sweet-smelling wood. Its shrill
music delighted them.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the foreman replied to a question
of Mr. Duwell’s, “most sawmills are run by steam
power. Very few old-fashioned water wheels are
left in this part of the country. Let me show you
our wheel.”</p>

<p>“This is the sluice-way,” he explained, pointing
to a long narrow canal full of flowing water.
“The sluice-way leads the water from the pond
to the top of the wheel.”</p>

<p>Going down a flight of steps on the outside
of the building, they stood right beside the old
moss-covered wheel. It was a huge wooden framework<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with shelves or buckets all around the wide
rim to catch the water.</p>

<p>The water poured out of the sluice-way over
the wheel, turning it slowly and steadily. As
the wheel turned, the water kept falling with
noisy splashes into the stream below.</p>

<p>“What makes it go round?” asked Wallace
eagerly.</p>

<p>“The force and weight of the water pouring
over it,” replied the foreman. “That is what
we call water power.”</p>

<p>“Think of it, children!” said Mr. Duwell.
“That old wheel helped to build Mr. Emerson’s
house.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the foreman, “it has helped to build
many houses besides Mr. Emerson’s. That old
water wheel has been sawing wood just as you
see it now for over a hundred years.”</p>


<h3>III. The Carpenter</h3>

<p>On the way home the little party talked about
their adventures.</p>

<p>“Mr. Emerson must have had help to build
a house like that,” remarked Ruth after a
pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t build it, goosey,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>“Who did, then, Mr. Know-it-all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, the carpenter, of course,” Wallace replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” exclaimed Ruth. “The carpenter
builds the house for Mr. Emerson, and Mr. Emerson
has time to teach you boys.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly right, little girl,” said her
father.</p>

<p>“Besides, no one person can do many things
well. Perhaps Mr. Emerson is a better teacher
for not trying to do too many things,” Mrs.
Duwell added.</p>

<p>“I think a carpenter is wonderful, don’t you?”
said Wallace.</p>

<p>“The greatest man that ever lived was a carpenter,”
said his mother.</p>

<p>“Whoa, boy!” exclaimed Mr. Duwell, drawing
up the reins sharply. “Don’t get frightened at
a piece of paper, when you’ve done so well. Whoa,
there, boy!”</p>

<p>The horse seemed to understand the quiet
gentle voice, and settled down to an even trot.</p>

<p>“He will go well enough now,” said Mrs. Duwell.
“He knows we are headed for home.”</p>

<p>“So we are! I wish we were headed the other
way,” said Wallace. “What makes a good time
so short?” he asked, so seriously that everybody
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV. The Wolf’s Den</h3>

<p>“Mother, I may be late in getting home from
school this afternoon,” said Wallace on Monday
at noon. “Mr. Emerson said he was going to
take us for a walk after school to-day. He told
us to ask if it would be all right. Will it,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wallace, but try to be home before
dark.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about our trip at supper
time,” said Wallace. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>Wallace bounded in just as supper was being
put on the table.</p>

<p>“Good evening, everybody. Oh, it was fine!”
he exclaimed. “Mr. Emerson took us for a long
walk in the park—to a part I have never seen
before.”</p>

<p>“That was splendid,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“Now, tell us all about your trip,” said his
father, when Wallace had partly satisfied his
hunger.</p>

<p>Wallace began: “We walked until we reached
the wild part of the park. Soon we came to a
steep hill and a great pile of high rocks covered
with trees and bushes.</p>

<p>“‘How many of you boys have ever been in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
real cave?’ Mr. Emerson asked. Only three of
us had, and we were very much excited.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he said, ‘right above that big granite
rock there is a natural cave. It was found only
a few days ago. The opening was covered with
bushes, so nobody knew it was there. It must
have been the den of some wild animal years ago.
The opening is so small that only one boy can go
in at a time.’</p>

<p>“He divided us into four sections and made me
the leader of section one.</p>

<p>“One at a time we climbed up until all five
boys of my section were on top of the rock. There
was the cave, a dark opening in the rocks about
as big around as a barrel. Being the leader, I
had to go in first.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you scared?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“Well—it was exciting,” admitted her brother.
“I got down on my hands and knees and looked
in, but could see nothing. Then I crawled in.
It was as dark as a pocket. I tried to stand up
and bumped my head, the ceiling was so low.</p>

<p>“In a minute or two I could see better. The
walls of the cave were nothing but rocks. The
floor was covered with sand and dry leaves. There
was just room enough to turn around in, so I
turned around and crawled out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I call that pretty brave, Wallace, to go
in first,” his mother said.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t anything to be afraid of,
mother,” said Wallace. After a moment he continued,
“Well, after the boys in my group had
all been in, we climbed down, and the other sections
went up and did the same thing. Every
boy went in, although some of the little fellows
looked pretty white when they came out. Then
we sat on the rocks, and Mr. Emerson talked
about the homes of wild animals and the early
savages.</p>

<p>“‘What animal do you suppose lived in this
cave?’ Mr. Emerson asked us. Some guessed
wolves and some, bears. We finally decided to
name it The Wolf’s Den.</p>


<h3>V. The Cave Dwellers</h3>

<p>“Mr. Emerson said that wild animals live in
just the same way to-day as they always did.
They live in caves and holes in the ground or
in hollow trees, where they can hide and keep
warm.</p>

<p>“One boy spoke up, ‘How about dogs, Mr.
Emerson?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ Mr. Emerson said, ‘dogs are tame animals
now, although they used to be wild. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
even the dog’s house is a wooden cave which his
master builds for him.’</p>

<p>“He told us that a long time ago people lived
in caves which they dug in the earth like animals.
They were cave dwellers or cave men. The reason
we have better homes now is that we have
greater minds than animals and have learned to
use our hands and brains to build houses.</p>

<p>“He said that the cave men must have thought
it wonderful when they found they could make
stone hatchets sharp enough to cut down small
trees. With them they learned to make huts out of
wood, which were larger and more comfortable
than caves and just as safe from storms.</p>

<p>“As time went on, men paid more attention
to building. They learned to make houses of
stone and clay and brick. They kept on studying
and improving until they were able to build
great cities such as we have to-day.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Ruth, clapping her hands
as Wallace finished his story. “Wouldn’t Wallace
make a good teacher! That sounded exactly
like the way Mr. Emerson talks.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like so interesting, though,” said
Wallace. “He promised to show us his new
house when it is finished.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I like to go with you!” said Ruth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Are there any houses being built near you?</p>

<p>Have you ever watched the carpenter at work?</p>

<p>Tell about some of his tools.</p>

<p>In the early days in this country men had to build their
own houses. Were these log cabins as comfortable and well
built as our houses are to-day?</p>

<p>How is it that the carpenter can do so much better work
than you could?</p>

<p>Where does the carpenter get his lumber?</p>

<p>Have you ever visited a sawmill?</p>

<p>Wouldn’t you like to ask at the library for some books
that tell about cave men and cliff dwellers? about
lumbering?</p></div>

<h2>THE BRICKLAYER</h2>


<h3>I. The Fallen Chimney</h3>

<p>All day long the rain came pouring down. By
night the wind rose with a shriek and a roar,
banging unfastened shutters and rattling windows
in their casings.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what an awful night!” exclaimed
Ruth. “How glad I am that Fluffy is safe indoors!”
and she stroked the little cat lying on a
cushion on the sewing machine.</p>

<p>“And how glad I am that Harry Teelow found
that lost puppy to-day,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>“Pretty bad, isn’t it?” Mr. Duwell said, looking
up from his paper. “I don’t suppose the
bricklayer came to mend the chimney to-day.
He couldn’t have worked in such a storm.”</p>

<p>“No, he did not come,” replied Mrs. Duwell
with a troubled look. “Do you suppose there
is any danger of its tumbling down?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say,” replied Mr. Duwell, shaking
his head doubtfully. “I wish I had stopped
to see Mr. Bricklayer a week ago when I first
discovered how loose the bricks were, instead of
waiting until—”</p>

<p>But he did not finish the sentence, for bang!
even above the terrific noise of the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
came the sound of falling bricks and broken
glass.</p>

<p>The family rushed into the little kitchen, which
was built on the end of the house.</p>

<p>What a sight met their eyes!</p>

<p>Water was pouring through a hole in the ceiling
where the roof had given way. Rain splashed
in great gusty dashes through the window where
the bricks had broken through.</p>

<p>Already there was a little lake on the floor.</p>

<p>Ruth was the first to speak. “If it keeps on,”
she said, half laughing and half crying, “it will
be quite deep enough for Alice and the mouse and
the Dodo to swim in!” She was thinking of
Alice in Wonderland, you know.</p>

<p>That made everybody laugh, and all began to
work. They placed tubs and pails where they
would catch the water, and stuffed old cloths
into the broken window panes.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour before the family were
settled down again in the living room.</p>

<p>“Well, children, you can now understand
the saying, ‘Never put off till to-morrow
what should be done to-day,’” remarked Mr.
Duwell.</p>

<p>“It is a lesson none of us will soon forget,”
added Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Could you and I have mended the broken
chimney, father?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Not very well, my boy,” replied Mr. Duwell.
“‘Every man to his trade,’ you know. By the
way, I hope Mr. Bricklayer will be here before you
children start to school in the morning. Run to
bed now so that you can be up early to see him
begin his work.”</p>


<h3>II. The Bricklayer</h3>

<p>The next day dawned bright and sunny, with
only a merry little breeze to remind one of yesterday’s
storm.</p>

<p>The bricklayer did not come before the children
started to school in the morning, but just after
lunch. They had only time to watch him and
his helper climb to the roof.</p>

<p>“I am going to get home from school early,”
said Wallace; “maybe they will not be through
by that time.”</p>

<p>“I am, too,” Ruth chimed in. “I wonder what
bricks are,” she added.</p>

<p>“Bricks? Why, don’t you know?” asked Wallace.
“Our manual training teacher told us that
bricks are a sort of imitation stone made of
moistened clay and sand mixed together, and
shaped as we see them. They are baked in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
oven-like place, called a kiln, or dried in the
sun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t know that. I wonder who first
thought of making them. They are something
like sun-baked mud-pies,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Our teacher said that bricks three thousand
years old have been found in Egypt, some with
writing on them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember that the Bible tells about
bricks. Why, Wallace, men must have been
bricklayers for thousands of years!”</p>

<p>“It is lucky for us they haven’t forgotten how
to make them, for what could we do without
a chimney?” said Wallace. “Hello, there is
Harry! I want to see him about the ball game;”
and away he ran.</p>


<h3>III. After School</h3>

<p>Wallace brought Harry, and Ruth brought
Mildred Maydole home after school to watch
the bricklayer work.</p>

<p>“Why, how straight and true the bricks must
be!” exclaimed Harry. “A bricklayer has to be
very careful, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Indeed he does,” replied Wallace. “Do you
know what the mortar is made of?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think I do. It is lime and sand and—something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
else,” Harry said. That made them
all laugh.</p>

<p>“I think the most wonderful brick work I ever
saw,” said Mildred, “was in the arch of a big
sewer. I couldn’t tell why the bricks didn’t
all fall down. My father said the mortar held
them.”</p>

<p>“Why, if it weren’t for bricklayers, and cement
workers, and stone masons, we should be without
lots of things!” exclaimed Harry. “Just imagine
it, if you can.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Wallace. “Let’s count what
we know of that they build for us—sewers, bridge
piers,—go on, Mildred.”</p>

<p>“Pavements,” added Mildred.</p>

<p>“Houses and chimneys,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Foundations for houses,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Here comes father!” cried Ruth suddenly;
and all the children ran to meet him.</p>

<p>“We’ve been talking about how it would
be if there were no bricklayers, or stone
masons, or cement workers, father,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that,” said Mr. Duwell. “I
was thinking very much the same thing as I
walked home so soon after such a heavy rain
without getting my feet wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“I remember what Benjamin Franklin wrote,”
he went on, “about the streets of Philadelphia
in his day. He said the mud after a storm was
so deep that it came above the people’s shoe-tops.
It was Benjamin Franklin himself who
first talked of paving the streets.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad they aren’t as bad as they were in
Benjamin Franklin’s time,” said Mildred.</p>

<h2>THE PLUMBER, THE PLASTERER,<br />
THE PAINTER</h2>


<h3>I. A Visit to a Little Town</h3>

<p>“I have an errand to do just outside the city
limits,” said Mr. Duwell one pleasant Saturday
morning. “Would you like to go with me, Wallace?”</p>

<p>“I certainly should,” said the boy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes father and son were on the
electric car, speeding toward Oldtown.</p>

<p>When there, they walked up the main street,
which was lined with rows of shabby houses,
badly in need of paint. Little pools of standing
water lay in the gutters.</p>

<p>“What an awful smell! I should think it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
make people sick! And look at the flies!” exclaimed
Wallace.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it does make people sick,”
said Mr. Du well. “Flies and mosquitoes breed
very rapidly in such places.”</p>

<p>“Flies and mosquitoes carry disease germs,
Mr. Emerson says,” observed Wallace.</p>

<p>“So they do; they are more dangerous
to health than poi-son-ous snakes,” his father
said.</p>

<p>“Why don’t the people clean their gutters?”
asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“I suppose they do sometimes,” replied his
father; “but Oldtown will never be clean and
healthy while the dirty water from the houses is
drained into the streets and alleys. Waste water
must be carried off by means of pipes into a sewer.
That is the work of the plumber. A good
plumber is a health officer.”</p>

<p>“What a lot of people it takes to keep things
going right, father! This town certainly does
need a plumber,” remarked Wallace.</p>

<p>This remark seemed to please Mr. Duwell very
much.</p>

<p>“How would you like to move to Oldtown,
Wallace?” asked his father when their errand was
finished and they were riding home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind,” said Wallace, “if I were a
plumber.”</p>


<h3>II. At Home</h3>

<p>When Ruth saw them coming, she ran to meet
them.</p>

<p>“What do you think, father!” she exclaimed;
“the plasterer came while you were gone, and
mended the kitchen ceiling. Mother is so pleased!
Come and look at it!”</p>

<p>“That’s very well done,” said Mr. Duwell,
examining the neat patch over the large hole
which the falling chimney had made. “But
it makes the whole room look as if it needed
a new coat of paint. What do you think,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I think it would make me a better cook to
have a nice clean kitchen,” said Mrs. Duwell,
smiling.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t be a better cook, mother!”
Wallace said, eyeing the good meal which was
ready to be put on the dining table.</p>

<p>“That is what we all think, Wallace,” said his
father; “and we think, too, that such a good cook
deserves a better kitchen. So on Monday I will
ask the painter to see about doing the walls and
woodwork.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<h3>III. The New Kitchen</h3>

<p>When the men had finished their work the
kitchen was so changed that it scarcely knew
itself, as Wallace said.</p>

<p>Instead of dim walls and dull-gray paint,
everything was white and blue. A shining white
sink with two bright nickel spigots was standing
proudly in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duwell had just finished hanging a white
dotted muslin curtain at the window over the
sink when Ruth entered.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, doesn’t that look lovely!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I thought such a bright clean kitchen deserved
a clean new curtain,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the kitchen beautiful!” Ruth went on.
“It seems like living in a fairy tale—as though
we had wakened up to find things changed by
magic.”</p>

<p>“It does, in a way,” agreed her mother; “but,
really, they were every-day fairies who brought
about these changes and turned ugliness into
beauty.”</p>

<p>“I think I know their names,” Ruth said,
laughing; “Mr. Plumber, Mr. Plasterer, and Mr.
Painter.”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you guess?” said her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE COAL MAN AND THE MINER</h2>


<h3>I. Black Diamonds</h3>
<div class="figright" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i-201.jpg" width="324" height="248" alt="mining car" />
</div>
<p>“How are the
black diamonds
holding out,
Wallace?” asked
Mrs. Duwell.
Wallace had just
brought up coal
from the cellar.</p>



<p>“Only a few more
scuttlefuls in the bin, mother,” answered
Wallace.</p>

<p>“On your way from school you may stop at
the coal yard and ask Mr.
Carr to send a ton to-morrow.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i-201b.jpg" width="321" height="246" alt="coal mine" />
</div>

<p>“All right, mother,
I won’t forget. But
tell me, why do
they call coal black
diamonds?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to talk about it now. Perhaps Mr. Carr will
tell you. You have just ten minutes to get to
school.”</p>

<p>On his way home Wallace stepped into the
little office of the big coal yard.</p>

<p>“How are you, my boy; what can I do for you
to-day?” asked Mr. Carr, who was a rather tall
man with a bent back and one shoulder higher
than the other.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Carr?” replied Wallace.
“Mother wants you to send a ton of coal to-morrow—the
same kind as the last you sent.”</p>

<p>Wallace waited until the coal man entered the
order in the book and then asked, “Mr. Carr, will
you tell me why they call coal black diamonds?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carr smiled pleasantly. “Certainly, son,
certainly. You see, coal shines like diamonds,
and then, it’s worth more.”</p>

<p>“Worth more? Why, I thought diamonds
were worth more than anything else.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! If there weren’t any coal in the
ground, all the diamonds in the world wouldn’t
heat a house, cook a meal, pull a railway train,
or run a machine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never thought of that,” said Wallace.
“You certainly could not burn diamonds in a
cook-stove.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Mr. Carr, who seemed
much pleased at Wallace’s interest.</p>


<h3>II. In a Coal Mine</h3>

<p>“Were you ever down in a coal mine, Mr.
Carr?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Was I ever down in a coal mine?” repeated
Mr. Carr. “Yes, sir, I was a miner for years
in the coal regions, and would have been in a
mine yet, probably, if it hadn’t been for this,”
pointing to his shoulder and bent back.</p>

<p>“Is it very dangerous work?” asked Wallace,
with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, if the roof doesn’t fall on you, and if
the mine doesn’t catch fire, and if the gas doesn’t
choke you, or explode and blow you up, it isn’t
dangerous; it is perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“But how did it get hurt—your shoulder, I
mean?” asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Oh, that! I’ll tell you. One day we were
getting out coal at the far end of a tunnel. Suddenly,
before we had time to run, the roof came
tumbling down and buried us. When they pulled
us out, my helper was dead, and my back was
as you see it now.”</p>

<p>“What makes mining so dangerous?” asked
Wallace, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, it’s this way. When you step
into the cage, that is the elevator, you leave the
sunlight behind. The cage sinks down, down
into pitch darkness, sometimes hundreds of
feet. At the bottom of the shaft it is like an
under-ground city. Street-like tunnels, with
car tracks laid on them, run out in every
direction. The coal cars are drawn by mules
or by electricity.</p>

<p>“As you go up the tracks you see cross tunnels
and the miners’ little lamps shining in dark holes
that look like black caves. Here the miners
work, blasting out the coal, and loading it on
cars to be drawn to the mouth of the mine and
hoisted up into daylight.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the walls and roof are not properly
braced. Then they cave in and great lumps of
coal fall down on the men. Sometimes gas or
fire-damp collects. Then there is danger of choking
or of being blown up. Sometimes, in blasting,
the coal catches fire, so that the whole mine
burns.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/i-205.jpg" width="510" height="597" alt="minder with photos in the background" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Can you tell a story about the journey of a ton of coal from
the time the miner digs it out of the mine, and boys sort out the
slate, until it is put into the furnace in a house?</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Why, miners must be as brave as soldiers,”
said Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose they are brave. People do not
know how much they owe to the miners. They
risk their lives every time they go down into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a><br /><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>the mines. But they don’t think much about
the danger. That is part of their work.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for telling me about it,” said
Wallace.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, my boy; good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Carr.”</p>

<p>Wallace hurried home with a new respect for
Mr. Carr and the men who work in the dark
mines under the ground.</p>

<h2>THE DENTIST</h2>


<h3>I. Why Ruth Was Afraid</h3>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sobbed Ruth. “O—h, dear!”
She was sitting in her little rocking-chair in
the living-room.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Wallace,
coming in to look for his books. “Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>“No;” Ruth shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Wallace, I am so afraid I’m going to be
hurt. Mother says there is a dark spot on one of
my teeth. She is getting ready to take me to
Doctor Harrison’s. I have never had a tooth
filled.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the silly things I ever heard of,”
exclaimed Wallace, “that’s the silliest! What
makes you think the dentist will hurt you?”</p>

<p>Ruth looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever heard the boys and girls
talk of how they were hurt when they had teeth
filled?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have heard some boys talk,” Wallace
admitted; “but they were boys who never cleaned
their teeth—”</p>

<p>“And who did not see a dentist until they had
a toothache,” added Mrs. Duwell, overhearing
Wallace’s remark as she entered the room.</p>

<p>“What, crying?” she asked, noticing Ruth’s
swollen eye-lids. “Why, my dear little girl, the
dentist is one of your best friends.”</p>

<p>“I guess some of the girls and boys would like
him better if he didn’t hurt them so much,
mother,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the dentist’s fault, children,” said
Mrs. Duwell. “If boys and girls had their teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
examined once or twice a year, the dentist would
catch the trouble in time and save them much
pain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose dentists ever want to hurt
anyone,” Ruth said.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I think they are very kind to be
willing to do so in order to save teeth. It is
dreadful to have bad teeth. Nothing tastes just
right; and worse than that, bad teeth mean bad
health. Good teeth are a grist mill to grind our
food. Without good teeth we cannot have good
health.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Wallace. “Even horses
aren’t worth much after their teeth are gone.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t they wear false ones?” asked Ruth
with such seriousness that Wallace burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“I wish they could, poor things,” said her
mother; “but come, dear, we must start.”</p>

<h3>II. At the Dentist’s</h3>

<p>“Ah, here is a little girl whose mouth looks as
though she brushed her teeth regularly,” said
Doctor Harrison, as he raised the big comfortable
arm chair in which Ruth was sitting.</p>

<p>“She certainly is good about that, doctor,”
said Mrs. Duwell.</p>

<p>“Even so,” said the doctor, “I think I shall
give her one of my little picture cards.”</p>

<p>Ruth looked so pleased that he handed her
two.</p>

<p>“One is for Wallace,” Ruth said.</p>

<p>“That picture is to remind forgetful children,”
said the doctor. “Now let us look at the twenty-odd
pearls in your mouth, little girl.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Oh, Wallace, Doctor Harrison didn’t hurt
me a bit,” cried Ruth, running into the living-room
after they had reached home. “He said
that he didn’t often hurt people who came
to him in time. Here is a card, he gave me
for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Wallace, looking at the
card. “Oh, it’s to remind me to brush my teeth.
I wonder if he thought I needed it.”</p>

<p>“No, Doctor Harrison didn’t say that, Wallace;
but he did say that we wouldn’t want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
eat anything with dirty
hands, and that really
dirty teeth are worse
than dirty hands.”</p>

<h2>THE DRUGGIST, THE NURSE, AND THE<br />
DOCTOR</h2>


<h3>I. The Sick Baby</h3>

<p>“Ruth, I wish you would stop at Doctor Marcy’s
office on your way to school,” said Mrs. Duwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a few days later, “and ask him to come to see
the baby. The little thing has a high fever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I hope baby won’t be sick!” exclaimed
Ruth, kissing her mother good-by.</p>

<p>All the morning she remembered her mother’s
troubled look. At noon she did not stop to talk
with the girls, but hurried home as fast as she
could.</p>

<p>Wallace was there before her, though, having
run all the way. He met her at the door.</p>

<p>“Ruth,” he whispered, “I met Doctor Marcy
as he came out, and he says that the baby has
pneumonia,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and it is a bad case. Mother
doesn’t know I am home. Can’t we get some
lunch ready to take to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied Ruth, tiptoeing into
the kitchen. “You put the kettle on the fire
and I’ll make some tea and milk toast.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Duwell looked very pale and weary when
the children appeared with the lunch tray.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were home, Ruth,” she
whispered, stepping into the hall. “How quietly
you must have worked, children.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything else we can do to help?”
asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, there is, Wallace. You may take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
this pre-scrip-tion to the drug store to be filled.
Ask the druggist to send the medicine over as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Just then the baby gave a pitiful little moan,
which made the mother turn again to the crib.
The children stole softly downstairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/i-214.jpg" width="509" height="377" alt="Wallace at drug store" />
</div>

<p>“I’ll run right over to the drug store, Ruth,”
Wallace said, forgetting his own lunch.</p>


<h3>II. The Druggist</h3>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Jones,” he said breathlessly
as he entered the store. “Baby is very ill,
and mother wishes this prescription filled. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
told me to ask if you would please send the medicine
over just as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Baby sick? How sorry I am, Wallace,” said
Mr. Jones. “Of course we will send it soon. I
will see to it at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you.” Wallace drew a sigh of
relief. “How much will it be, please?”</p>

<p>The druggist examined the queer Latin words
of the doctor’s prescription. “This calls for one
very expensive medicine, Wallace,” he said; “so
we shall have to charge seventy-five cents.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” said Wallace.</p>

<p>When he reached home Ruth had a nice lunch
spread for him.</p>

<p>“I am not going to school this afternoon, Wallace,”
she told him. “I’m going to tidy up the
house, and help mother.”</p>

<p>“Look at the clock, Ruth!” exclaimed Wallace
suddenly, “I must start right away—the medicine
will be seventy-five cents.”</p>

<p>“I will have the money ready,” said Ruth.
“Good-by.”</p>

<p>The druggist’s boy came with the medicine a
few minutes after Wallace left, and the baby was
given the first dose at once.</p>

<p>When their father came the children had supper
ready, but no one ate much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad you can be so helpful, children,”
he said.</p>


<h3>III. The Trained Nurse</h3>

<p>For five days the whole family did everything
they knew to help save the baby’s life. Mr. Duwell
was worried not only about the baby but
about the children’s mother.</p>

<p>“I agree with the doctor that it would be
much wiser to have a trained nurse,” he said on
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>“But mother cannot bear the thought of letting
anyone else take care of the baby,” said
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I know that mother is a splendid nurse,”
Mr. Duwell continued; “but a trained nurse
knows all the best new methods of nursing, and
could give much relief to mother, who is tired
out.”</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang.</p>

<p>“It is the doctor,” said Ruth. Mr. Duwell
went to the door, followed by the little girl.</p>

<p>The doctor was not alone. With him was a
young lady. Ruth liked her at once; she seemed
so quiet and strong, and looked so kind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Do you think this is the right kind of bed for a sick baby? Why not?</span></div>
</div>

<p>“How do you do, sir?” said Doctor Marcy to
Mr. Duwell. “This is Miss Foster, a trained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a><br /><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>nurse. I am taking matters in my own hands,
you see. That good wife of yours is entirely
worn out.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to meet Miss Foster and I am
very much obliged to you for bringing her, doctor,”
Mr. Duwell replied.</p>

<p>“It seems to me to be the very best thing to do.
I have tried to persuade Mrs. Duwell to see
things that way,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh, come upstairs, doctor,” called Mrs. Duwell,
hearing the doctor’s voice; “I think baby is
scarcely breathing.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said the doctor to the nurse, leading
the way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duwell was standing near the crib as
they entered.</p>

<p>“This is the nurse I was talking about,” the
doctor said, introducing Miss Foster, and turning
to look at the baby.</p>

<p>“I am very glad—” Mrs. Duwell started to
speak, but she fainted away before she could
finish the sentence.</p>

<p>The nurse did not seem frightened. She laid
Mrs. Duwell flat on the floor. After sprinkling
cold water on her face, she held some smelling
salts to her nose.</p>

<p>In a minute or two Mrs. Duwell opened her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
eyes. “I must have fainted,” she said; “I am so
glad you were here, nurse. Doctor, how is baby?”</p>

<p>“About as I expected,” the doctor replied.
“I believe the worst will be over to-night. Now,
I want you to take this medicine which Miss
Foster will give you, and lie down for a while.
I expect to come back about ten o’clock to-night.
Good-by; please obey Miss Foster’s orders,” he
added.</p>

<p>“It is such a relief to my mind, doctor,” said
Mr. Duwell, meeting him at the foot of the stairs,
“to know that the nurse is here.”</p>

<p>“It is a relief,” replied the doctor. “If the
strain had kept on much longer, Mrs. Duwell
would have had a long term of illness.”</p>


<h3>IV. The Doctor, a Hero</h3>

<p>The doctor and nurse watched by the baby’s
bedside until the danger was passed. Both wore
happy smiles when the doctor assured the tired
Duwell family that the baby would live.</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor, money cannot pay you for your
kindness,” said Mrs. Duwell. “Through rain
and snow storms, at midnight and at daybreak,
you have come to help us. How tired you must
often be.”</p>

<p>“It is true, doctor,” Mr. Duwell added; “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
risk your life as willingly as a soldier does, every
time you go into danger.”</p>

<p>“We doctors don’t think anything about
that,” replied Doctor Marcy modestly. “We
are so anxious to have people get well.”</p>

<p>“Why, doctors are heroes like soldiers!” exclaimed
Wallace, looking at the doctor with
new respect. “I never thought of that before!”</p>

<p>“Nurses are, too,” whispered Ruth; but Doctor
Marcy overheard.</p>

<p>“That is right, Ruth,” he said. “Nurses are,
too.”</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>


<h4>The Druggist</h4>


<div class="blockquot3">

<p>How long does a druggist have to study in order to fill
prescriptions? Would it be safe to let those who have not
studied handle medicines? Why not?</p>

how it would be to live ten miles from a drug store?</p></div>


<h4>The Nurse</h4>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Can you give some reasons why a trained nurse can care

<p>Did you ever need a doctor at your house?</p>

<p>How did you let him know? Did he come quickly?</p>

<p>What might have happened if he had not come?</p>

<p>Pretend, you are a country doctor and tell about some of
your long drives. Do you think doctors are heroes? Why?</p></div>

<h2>THE JUNIOR RED CROSS</h2>


<p>In September, 1917, President Wilson sent
out a letter from the White House in Washington
to the school children of the United States.</p>

<p>He told them that the President of the United
States is the President of the American Red
Cross, and he said that the Red Cross people
wanted the children to help them in their work.</p>

<p>Their work, you know, is to help all those
who are suffering or in need.</p>

<p>Such work is so beautiful that it is really
doing golden deeds.</p>

<p>Now read for yourself this letter from the
President of the United States which belongs to
every school child in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="bbox">
<h3>A PROCLAMATION</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent"><i>To the School Children of the United States</i>:</p>

<p>The President of the United States is also President of
the American Red Cross. It is from these offices joined in
one that I write you a word of greeting at this time when so
many of you are beginning the school year.</p>

<p>The American Red Cross has just prepared a Junior
Membership with School Activities in which every pupil in
the United States can find a chance to serve our country.
The School is the natural center of your life. Through it
you can best work in the great cause of freedom to which we
have all pledged ourselves.</p>

<p>Our Junior Red Cross will bring to you opportunities of
service to your community and to other communities all
over the world and guide your service with high and religious
ideals. It will teach you how to save in order that suffering
children elsewhere may have a chance to live. It will teach
you how to prepare some of the supplies which wounded
soldiers and homeless families lack. It will send to you
through the Red Cross Bulletins the thrilling stories of
relief and rescue. And best of all, more perfectly than
through any of your other school lessons, you will learn by
doing those kind things under your teacher’s direction to be
future good citizens of this great country which we all love.</p>

<p>And I commend to all school teachers in the country the
simple plan which the American Red Cross has worked out
to provide for your coöperation, knowing as I do that school
children will give their best service under the direct guidance
and instruction of their teachers. Is not this perhaps the
chance for which you have been looking to give your time
and efforts in some measure to meet our national needs?</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>How do you suppose the school children of the United
States felt when they read this letter from the President?</p>

<p>It is a wonderful letter. It does not read like a letter
from a great man to little children.</p>

<p>It is different from most of the letters which grown
people write to children, for the President writes to the
children asking for their help, just as if they were grown up.</p>

<p>Indeed, when the grown people read the letter they wished
that they could be school children again, because there
was no Junior Red Cross when they were young, and they
had to wait to grew up before they could help the Red
Cross do golden deeds.</p>

<p>You see, when they were young, everybody thought,
“When the children are grown up they will help us.” Then
they waited for them to grow.</p>

<p>Are you not glad that you are able, while a child, to do
helpful work for your country?</p>

<p>Now let us think about some of the golden deeds which
the Red Cross does.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN<br />
TIMES OF PEACE</h2>


<p>Of course, in times of war the Red Cross is
very busy helping the soldiers, but do you think
that it is idle in times of peace?</p>

<p>No, indeed. The Red Cross is always listening
for a call of distress, and is ready to aid any
people who are suffering.</p>

<p>One day in 1912 the Red Cross heard the
people who lived along the banks of the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
River calling for help, for the river had
been so swollen by rains that it had risen high
and overflowed its banks in a dangerous flood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/i-232.jpg" width="512" height="497" alt="people on overflowing raft full of bundles; house roof just sticking up out of water" />
<div class="attrib"><i>Picture from a photograph</i></div>
</div>


<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Do you know what happens during a flood?</p>

<p>Name all the different things you see on the little island
in this picture.</p>

<p>Why do you suppose the people are all staying there
instead of rowing off in the boats?</p>

<p>Because they are expecting the relief launch of the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Cross to come and take them to a safe place. The water
is flowing too swiftly for the little boats to cross in safety.
They would probably be carried against a tree and upset.</p>

<p>Many houses have been carried down the river during
this flood, so you can understand how glad the people will
be to see help coming. In this next picture you will see
how the Red Cross answered the people’s cry for help.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>This picture shows a Carnegie Library which was used
by the Red Cross as a relief station during the Mississippi
flood.</p>

<p>The Red Cross spent thousands of dollars during this flood,
saving many lives and helping hundreds of flood victims.</p>

<p>Can you name some of the things the people needed?</p>

<p>What do you suppose they think of the Red Cross?</p>

<p>Imagine that a great wind storm or cyclone should come
very suddenly whirling through your city, tearing down
houses, uprooting trees, and leaving thousands of people
homeless—who would be the first to help the people who
were hurt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>This is just an example of the way the Red Cross is standing
ready to help in time of need.</p>

<p>If you read the <i>Red Cross Magazine</i> you will learn about
hundreds of golden deeds which the Red Cross is doing, for
the work of the Red Cross in times of peace and at all times
is to help people in distress and need.</p></div>

<h2>THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN<br />
TIMES OF WAR</h2>


<p>The work of the Red Cross during war is</p>

<p>First. To care for and nurse the wounded
among our own soldiers and sailors, and even
the wounded of the enemy who fall into the
hands of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Of course, in order to do this, millions of
people who are not doing the nursing can make
the articles needed for that purpose. What can
the Junior Red Cross do to help?</p>

<p>Second. To care for the families of the soldiers
and sailors who have given their services to their
country.</p>

<p>How can the Junior Red Cross help?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE RED CROSS</h2>


<p>Do you suppose that people always felt that
they should help everybody in such ways?</p>

<p>No; the Red Cross is not yet sixty years old.</p>

<p>War is thousands of years old.</p>

<p>In olden days when soldiers fought, there were
no kind Red Cross nurses to care for the
wounded. There were no faithful Red Cross
dogs to search for wounded soldiers after the
battle was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Often the suffering men died of neglect when
proper nursing would have saved their lives.
But no one ever thought of sending a band of
women nurses to wars to help the soldiers,
before the days of Florence Nightingale.</p>


<h3>Florence Nightingale</h3>

<p>Florence was a little English girl who always
said that when she grew up she would be a nurse.</p>

<p>She felt sorry to see any living creature suffer
and always tried to help it. Sometimes it was
a bird with a broken wing or an injured rabbit
that she tended.</p>

<p>All the neighbors brought their sick pets to
her. The little nurse finally had so many
patients that her father gave her a corner of the
greenhouse for a hospital. The animals learned
to love her and she had many friends among
them as you may imagine.</p>

<p>When she was a young woman nursing in a
London hospital, England’s soldiers were sent
to war with Russia’s soldiers. They had to
travel in ships all the way to the Crimea in
Russia. You see, they were a great distance
from home.</p>

<p>News of their terrible sufferings reached Florence
Nightingale in the hospital. Taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
band of nurses with her she went to nurse the
wounded soldiers in that far off land.</p>

<p>When the nurses arrived there, they found
thousands of sick and wounded men lying on
the hospital floors with no one to help them.
At once the brave nurses began to take care of
the soldiers as kindly as your mother takes care
of you when you are ill.</p>

<p>Do you wonder that many who would have
died, lived and were grateful all their lives to
he nurses?</p>

<p>Of course there were no gas or electric lights
in the rough hospitals of those days, so that
Miss Nightingale always carried a lighted lamp
when she made her good-night rounds. The
weary soldiers looked for the gleam of the lamp
in the darkness and were made happy by her
words of encouragement. That is how she came
to be called “The Lady of the Lamp.”</p>

<p>The story of Florence Nightingale and her
brave band spread far and near. It touched
the hearts of people everywhere, and made them
think about what could be done to relieve suffering
even before the days of the Red Cross.</p>

<h2>HOW THE RED CROSS CAME TO BE</h2>


<p>Among those who heard the story of what
Florence Nightingale and her brave nurses did
for the soldiers, was Henri Du-nant, a kind-hearted
Swiss gentleman.</p>

<p>He remembered it several years afterward
when he was present at a terrible battle between
the soldiers of Austria and those of France and
Sardinia. He saw thousands of wounded soldiers
dying almost without help.</p>

<p>In a book which he wrote about their sufferings,
he asked the question, “Why could not
the people of all countries make plans to care
for the sick and wounded during wars?”</p>

<p>And from his question came the great Red
Cross work in which we all have a part.</p>

<p>The Red Cross is more wonderful than any
war, for it comes from the kindness in people’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>We hope that long years from now there will
be no war.</p>

<p>But we cannot expect to have wars cease until
the <i>people</i>, and not the <i>kings</i>, of the great
countries of the world make their own laws.</p>

<p>Henri Dunant and Florence Nightingale were
like the children of to-day when they were little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
They liked to play the same kinds of games that
you do.</p>

<p>When Florence played nurse with her dolls she
did not dream of the great good she would do
for the whole world.</p>

<p>It may be that some of the boys and girls who
are now reading this story will be like Henri
Dunant and Florence Nightingale, and will
grow up to do great and noble work for others.</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>What do you think of people who help other people in
trouble?</p>

<p>What do you think of people who do not help people who
are in need of help?</p>

<p>Do you realize that the work of the Red Cross is entirely
the helping of people who need help?</p>

<p>Did a good neighbor ever come to your house and help
your people in time of illness or trouble?</p>

<p>You would be glad to help other people in just some such
way, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Are you not glad that the Junior Red Cross gives you a
chance to pass such kindness along?</p></div>


<h4>II</h4>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p>Mention some of the good deeds which you know the
Junior Red Cross has done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you ever sold Red Cross Christmas seals? What
does the Red Cross do with the money made from the sale
of Christmas seals?</p>

<p>How old is the Junior Red Cross?</p>

<p>It is a pretty young baby to have accomplished so much,
isn’t it? But do you know how fast it has grown?</p>

<p>When you see a person wearing a Red Cross button, you
know many things about that person.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the things that are shown:</p>

<p>1. Kindness. 2. Helpfulness. 3. Love of one’s country.</p>

<p>Can you name others?</p></div>

<h2>HOW I CAN HELP THE RED CROSS<br />

IN TIME OF WAR<br />

AND IN TIME OF PEACE</h2>


<p>1. By belonging to the Red Cross and trying
to get others to belong.</p>

<p>2. By learning to save in order that suffering
children elsewhere may have their share of food
and clothing.</p>

<p>3. By helping to prepare some of the supplies
that wounded soldiers and homeless families are
in need of.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/i-242.jpg" width="487" height="199" alt="dog carrying supplies in mouth to wounded soldier" />
</div>
<p>4. By reading stories of relief and rescue so
that I can tell others about the Red Cross.</p>

<p>5. By learning to be a good citizen of my
country even before I grow up.</p>

<p>The Junior Members of the Red Cross try to
share their good things with those who do not
have them.</p>

<p>Has your school an American Red Cross School Auxiliary

<p>Do you know that the American Red Cross serves the
government of the United States, and that the members of
the Red Cross are the best citizens of our country?</p>

<p>The Red Cross means being good neighbors—working
together.</p></div>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired. The table of contents uses the
œ ligature in Phœbe Cary’s name. In the text it’s italic and
the transcriber assumes that the printer didn’t have an italic ligature.

name now have the ligature.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
